      "In May 2021, a 96 year-old businessman died in Rome, Italy. In his lifetime, Ahmed Idris Nasreddin might have amassed a personal fortune of close to half a billion dollars, but the death of NASCO Group’s multimillionaire founder barely made the news. At first glance, the only extraordinary thing about his life story was that it embodied the African entrepreneurship dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nasreddin was an Eritrean who moved to Jos in Nigeria’s Plateau State, and grew his father’s small manufacturing business into a $460 million conglomerate involved in everything from breakfast cereal and confectionery to pharmaceuticals, real estate and energy. After many years of growth and success, he eventually handed his sprawling business empire over to his son Attia Nasreddin, and retired at an old, satisfied age.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an official statement released after Nasreddin’s death in May, Plateau State governor Simon Lalong said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“NASCO has over the years remained a major employer of labour in Plateau and continues to contribute to the economic prosperity of the State and Nigeria at large through tax revenue and corporate social responsibility.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well that was the cover story, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "In reality, as is so often the case in Nigeria, the gap between the facts and the information released to the public is so wide as to be scarcely believable. What on earth could this shrewd, respectable businessman who looked like he could not hurt a fly have done, to put him in the same article as a story about the world’s deadliest terrorist organisation? Why would the brand he built, which to many Nigerians evokes memories of a beloved childhood breakfast staple, appear in the same sentence as Boko Haram?\n",
      "\n",
      "To answer these questions, our story begins on another continent in 1955, some 8 years before his father would move to Nigeria and establish NASCO Group.\n",

      "A Scholar From Zamfara\n",
      "\n",
      "The year is 1955, and a 33 year-old Islamic scholar from Gummi in modern day Zamfara State has made his way to Mecca for his first Hajj pilgrimage. Alongside him is a certain Ahmadu Bello, who is the Premier of Northern Nigeria. During this trip, the scholar impresses both Ahmadu Bello and the Saudi King Sa’ud with his Arabic translation skills. He rapidly makes a big impression on many locals and clerics in Mecca.\n",
      "\n",
      "These relationships will later become his most valuable asset following the events that take place after his subsequent return to Nigeria. Upon returning to Nigeria, he takes up positions teaching Arabic Studies at Islamic schools in Kano and Kaduna. His style of teaching focuses on educating his students about the differences between Islamic religious doctrine and local customs. Based on his strict Sunni understanding of the Qur’an, he teaches his students to adopt a ‘pure’ Islamic identity at the expense of practises that he considered bid’ah (roughly translated as ‘innovation’ or ‘corruption’).\n",
      "\n",
      "He also becomes the first Islamic scholar to translate the Qur’an from Arabic into Hausa, which puts him in a uniquely influential position comparable to that of Ajayi Crowther in 19th century southwestern Nigeria. Using this leverage, he becomes an increasingly powerful figure in Northern Nigeria, with his essentialist views on Islamic doctrine gaining popularity. To him, the existing Sufi orders of Northern Nigeria are polluted with bid’ah and unfit for purpose. He becomes well known for attacking the Tijaniya and Qadriyya brotherhoods during his appearances on Radio Kaduna, while advocating for a ‘return’ to ‘Islamic purity.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the death of his friend and benefactor Ahmadu Bello, the scholar finds himself in a precarious situation. The new Nigerian federal government led by soldiers has a motive to crack down on anyone who is outspoken and influential. He may be a giant in Northern Nigeria, but he is a giant with feet of clay. His solution is to seek financial, doctrinal and political help from his friends in Mecca. The Saudis, as always, are ready to help.\n",
      "\n",
      "His Saudi backers are keen to use him to espouse the Saudi Arabian state’s official interpretation of Islam, which is based on the work of 18th century Islamic scholar Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab. This fundamentalist doctrine, often known as Wahabbism fits very closely with the teachings of our hero in Northern Nigeria, and he enthusiastically sets about gathering support for this new Saudi-funded project. In the 2009 book ‘The Wahhabi Mission and Saudi Arabia,’ historian David Commins says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The [Saudi-funded Muslim World] League also sent missionaries to West Africa, where it funded schools, distributed religious literature and gave scholarships to attend Saudi religious universities. These efforts bore fruit in Nigeria's Muslim northern region with the creation of a movement (the Izala Society) dedicated to wiping out ritual innovations. Essential texts for members of the Izala Society are Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's treatise of God's unity and commentaries by his grandsons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Reaching out to his erstwhile students across Kaduna and Kano over the course of the 1970s, the scholar-turned-politician slowly builds a coalition of strategically-aligned individuals who will someday become very powerful people in Northern Nigeria. In 1978, one of his prominent students, Sheikh Ismaila Idris takes charge of this increasingly powerful but somewhat unofficial movement, and calls it Jama'atu Izalatil Bid’ah Wa Iqamatus Sunnah (Society of Removal of Innovation and Re-establishment of the Sunnah), also known as JIBWIS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based in Jos and known colloquially as the Izala Movement, this organisation will go on to become the most influential Islamic body in Nigeria over the next few decades. Its members will become some of Nigeria’s most revered Imams and clerics. They will achieve high ranks in the Nigerian Armed Forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "They will sit on the Federal Executive Council.\n",
      "\n",
      "JIBWIS will come to exert a level of influence over Nigeria’s national politics and governance that is unprecedented for a religious body in Nigeria. Soon, it will become almost impossible to achieve power in many parts of Northern Nigeria without identifying with the Izala Movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among other things, the scholar states that Muslims should never accept a non-Muslim as ruler, which can be interpreted as a call for insurrection against a Christian Nigerian president. He is never held to account for this statement. In any case, he no longer believes that writing books or teaching people about Islam will on their own, lead to an Islamic renaissance in Northern Nigeria. Now he is all about partnership and politicking. He maintains his membership in Northern Nigeria’s legacy Islamic group, Jama'atu Nasril Islam (“Group for the Victory of Islam”), but he is unmistakably the beating heart of the new Izala Movement. To all intents and purposes, this is the birth of modern Salafist Islam in Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without firing a shot or winning an election, this Islamic scholar has become one of the most powerful men in Northern Nigeria\n",
      "\n",
      "His name?\n",
      "\n",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: Sheikh Ahmad Abubakar Gumi is the son of Abubakar Mahmud Gumi.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Clerics, The Saudis and What Happened in Algeria\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward 33 years. It is Christmas Day in 2011 and Abubakar Gumi has been dead for over 19 years. A bomb suddenly goes off at St. Theresa Catholic Church, Madalla, on the outskirts of Abuja, killing 35 people and wounding a further 52. Almost simultaneously, a series of coordinated bomb attacks and shootings take place at churches in Jos, Gadaka and Damaturu. An obscure Islamist group calling itself Boko Haram claims responsibility for the attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the trial of the main suspect Kabiru Umar A.K.A Kabiru Sokoto 2 years later, a masked witness claims that an Algerian Islamist group provided funding and support worth N40,000,000 ($250,000 at the time) to carry out the attacks. To the general public, it is unclear what the link is between Islamists in Northern Nigeria and well-funded terror groups in North Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "To those in the know however, the incidents of December 25, 2011 are not only expected, but are likely to intensify and become more regular. This is because while the Nigerian public up to this point has been fed with what amounts to a tiny percentage of the actual story behind the Boko Haram group, this group has in fact been incubating and nurtured at the highest levels of the theological, economic and political spaces in Northern Nigeria. Boko Haram in reality, is so much bigger than Mohammed Yusuf and Abubakar Shekau that reducing it to those 2 men serves to miss the actual story spectacularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start to get some of the picture of what Boko Haram is and where it came from, let us retreat from 2011 to 2006 to read an excerpt from a letter written by the Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations, Aminu B. Wali, addressed to the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. This letter is available in full here from the official repository for UN documents. Written by the Nigerian government to the UN, it lays out the measures it has taken to fight terrorism in Nigeria. Take special note of the names mentioned in bold.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Wikileaks cable from 2002 confirms that this arrest actually did take place, only for the suspect to be released inexplicably after 27 days in detention.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those who are not aware, Yakubu Musa Kafanchan, also known as Sheikh Yakubu Musa Katsina and Yakubu Musa Hassan is a founding member of the Izala Movement (JIBWIS), and is in fact, the current Chairman of its board of trustees and the Chairman of the Katsina State JIBWIS chapter. He is a widely respected Islamic cleric and a very close personal friend and public associate of - no prizes for guessing - Isa Ali Pantami. Yes, that Isa Pantami.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kafanchan was even recently named as one of the 500 Most Influential Muslims in the World by The Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre, a Jordanian government-affiliated NGO. More on that later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently Mr. Kafanchan has been known to the Nigerian security forces as the leader of a terror network trying to set up terror cells in Katsina and Kano as far back as 2002. Keep that date in mind because it will become even more important as we unravel this further. According to official Nigerian government communication to the UN, this real-life Islamic terror organiser is known to have affiliations with a certain ‘GSPC’ group trying to carry out terror attacks in Nigeria, and he was even arrested for it in 2002 - 7 whole years before the world ever heard of a “Boko Haram.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet in 2021 he is not only a free man, but a powerful free man, with access to federal ministers, state governors and President Muhammadu Buhari himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then there is the GSPC angle. ‘GSPC’ stands for “Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat” (Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat). A full primer on the origin of the group and what it stands for is available here. Cliff notes summary: It is an illegal Salafi terrorist organisation based in Algeria which is affiliated with Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. It specialises in providing training, funding and support to Islamists and jihadi fighters around the world using a vast global network of smugglers, money launderers and rat lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brings us to the second name in the above letter excerpt. Alhaji Shahru Haruna, in the Nigerian government’s own words, is a GSPC agent who funds the activities of people like Kabiru Sokoto by laundering proceeds from smuggled goods. He too, was arrested and held on terror financing charges. Somehow he too, is not only a free man today, but a powerful one in his own right too.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will not surprise the reader to find out that Alhaji Haruna is also a ranking member of the Izala Movement. According to these posts I dug up from Facebook accounts linked to the Kano State Izala Movement chapter, Alhaji Haruna is the Deputy President of the Kano State chapter of JIBWIS. Like Yakubu Kafanchan, this indicted terror funder not only retains his position in Nigeria’s most influential Muslim body, but is also a respected Islamic preacher with access to the Who’s Who of Nigerian politics and governance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even more interestingly, when I do some digging into Mr. Haruna, I discover something potentially even more alarming. It will be recalled that in September 2021, CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele claimed that a significant portion of dollars bought by Bureau de Change (BDC) operators in Nigeria goes into illegal importation of arms. Speaking at the end of the monthly Monetary Policy Committee meeting, he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whether it’s Boko Haram, kidnapping and all sorts of nefarious activities, BDCs take our country’s dollar and sell to people to go and buy arms and ammunition to come and hurt us. That’s what people want us to continue to do. We cannot do that any longer. We can’t. If you have any legal, legitimate business you want to conduct, please take your business to a bank, they will sell you forex.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A search of Nigeria’s Corporate Affairs Commission database for the name “Shahru Haruna” turns up a plethora of companies registered under the “Dan Diyma” name.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man identified by the Nigerian government itself as a security threat for funding terror via money laundering was somehow allowed to own and operate a BDC, which according to the CBN governor, could well have been doing precisely that. A CBN circular from October 2020 confirms that at least as recently as last year, Haruna Shahru was allowed to run a BDC in Nigeria, potentially giving him access to the very funding infrastructure that he should not have under any circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "A glance at one of the other “Dan Diyma” business entities shows that even the email address used to register this entity - purportedly a petroleum company, albeit one with zero identifiable corporate footprint - belongs to Dan Diyma BDC, which says everything about how important the BDC is to Haruna Shahru. The question left unanswered is “Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "In case the reader is wondering if this picture can get any worse, the answer is yes. It can, and it will. Take note of the name circled in red below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zahraddeen Shahru Haruna is Shahru Haruna’s son, so it is no surprise for him to show up as a director on his father’s BDC registration documents. There’s just one problem. Remember Emefiele saying that BDCs facilitate terror financing? Well just a month before he made that comment, a circular was sent out to banks by the CBN with the names of 18 companies and individuals whose bank accounts were to be frozen with a PND (Post No Debit) mandate. Very unusually, no reason was given for the instruction, and also unusually, on a list made up of corporate accounts, there was an account belonging to an individual. His name?\n",
      "\n",
      "From Eritrea With Love\n",
      "\n",
      "We now rejoin our Eritrean friend in the year 2006. The Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) has recently been gazetted, and one of the first things its counter-terrorism unit does is to freeze all assets linked to NASCO Group Nigeria Limited. Apparently, Mr. Nasreddin has been doing some creative accounting to hide the fact that he is moving money around the world to fund Islamist terror organisations. Or at least, that was what the Nigerian government itself wrote to the UN in the same letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Wikileaks cable from 2002 hints at American hesitancy on the subject of freezing NASCO’s Nigerian assets due to the economic implications for Plateau State and political implications in Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real proof of Nasreddin’s double life however, comes from the US Treasury Department which publishes a comprehensive account of how he launders and moves money around the world for terrorist entities. Want to hear the real kicker? Nasreddin has been funding and laundering money for none other than GSPC - the Algerian terrorist group which Yakubu Katsina and Shahru Haruna are also involved with at the exact same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nigerian jihadis being trained in Algerian camps in 2002 will later return to Nigeria and make up the core of what will later become known as “Boko Haram.” And - what a coincidence - NASCO is also based in Jos, which so happens to be the headquarters of the Izala Movement and its many North African dalliances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using money made from selling market-leading FMCGs to Nigerian consumers, a cross-border network of terrorism is being nurtured that will someday kill the very kids eating NASCO cornflakes every morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s all thanks to this nice gentleman from Eritrea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ahmed Idris Nasreddin\n",
      "\n",
      "Nasreddin however, is a very rich man. Like all very rich men, he appears to have a way around problems that would ground other people. In 2005, Lisa Myers and Aram Roston of the NBC News Investigative Unit discover that despite his designation as a terror financier in the US, Nasreddin’s Nigerian business empire and his Italian hotel are still operating as normal. Quoted in the story, Victor Comras, a former terror-finance expert at the State Department says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“This isn't a loophole, this is failure to implement the sanctions appropriately. He's been involved in terrorist financing. Let's put him out of business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That would prove easier said than done because just 2 years later in 2007, the LA Times publishes a story indicating that - to all intents and purposes - Nasreddin has cut some kind of deal with the US government, likely involving asset forfeitures, to get his name off the list of terror financiers. He has been indicted for funding terror, some of which has found its way into the lives of the Nigerian consumers who have made him fabulously wealthy, but he is off the hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the people who have died in the Madalla Christmas Day Bombings facilitated by the people he funded and supported, there will be no justice. Nasreddin gets to hand over NASCO to his son, and he lives out the rest of his life in peace and comfort, dying at the ripe old age of 96.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friends and Alliances in High Places\n",
      "\n",
      "I mentioned earlier that the date of Yakubu Katsina’s initial attempt to establish terror cells and Taliban training camps in Kano and Katsina was important. Here is why. Remember Abubakar Gumi’s stated position that Muslims should never accept a non-Muslim as ruler? It just so happens that the concerted push for Sharia Law across 12 of Northern Nigeria’s states lines up perfectly with the election of Olusegun Obasanjo as president in 1999.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examining the eras of Shehu Shagari, Muhammadu Buhari, Ibrahim Babangida, Sani Abacha and Abdulsalam Abubakar as consecutive Muslim Nigerian heads of state, it is nearly impossible to establish the existence of directed and coordinated push for Islamic law in that area. Following Obasanjo’s entry however, Zamfara, Kano, Sokoto, Katsina, Bauchi, Borno, Jigawa, Kebbi, Yobe, Kaduna, Niger and Gombe decided in quick succession to embrace a separate penal code from southern Nigeria, based on Sharia law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding the political resonance of the Izala Movement in Northern Nigeria and the power wielded by the indicted terror financiers and terrorists who still sit on its board is key to understanding 2 things about terrorism in Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boko Haram is a logical development growing out of the rise of political Islam in Nigeria, with its roots in Salafism, popularised by Abubakar Gumi and his ideological heirs. It is impossible to divorce Abubakar Gumi’s use of Saudi money and Wahhabi indoctrination in the 1970s, from the adoption of Sharia Law in Northern Nigeria, the rise of violent Salafists like Abubakar Shekau and Isa Pantami, and the eventual inevitable mass uprising against the Nigerian state that will take place in the north.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Boko Haram brand is an unattractive one, the goals of Boko Haram are by no means unattractive to those who make up the ideological core of the Izala Movement, which is Nigeria’s most influential Islamic sect. Aminu Daurawa who famously praised the September 11 attacks in a 2001 sermon with a quote claiming that “Allah is a suicide bomber,” would later become the inaugural chair of Kano’s Hisbah police and also remains a high ranking Izala Movement member. With sympathisers and collaborators up to and including President Buhari himself, the Izala Sect has no incentive or reason to fundamentally rethink or change its ideology - which is directly and provably linked to Salafist terrorism.\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as Isa Pantami’s “Mr Zero Zero” (a reference to Muhammadu Buhari as an ideologically pure Muslim with zero tolerance for bid’ah. i.e a hardline Salafist) retains his obvious and unapologetic sympathy for an organisation with clear and ongoing links to the enemy he claims to be fighting against as Nigeria’s president, the Izala Movement has no incentive to reinvent itself. There is no way that the Nigerian president is not aware of Yakubu Musa Hassan Katsina’s history as a known terrorist, as well as the Izala Movement’s extremely problematic history and current composition. And yet, as recently as 2018, President Buhari was pictured in Aso Rock meeting with Izala Movement president Abdullahi Bala Lau, Yakubu Musa Hassan Katsina, Kabiru Gombe and Ibrahim Jalo Jalingo.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is either I have more access to information about his friends and associates than the Nigerian president does, with a plethora of intelligence and information gathering agencies at his disposal, or he knows all this already and he has chosen a side. Clearly, to the Izala Movement, this picture taken in 2018, was a statement. An Obasanjo government may have arrested Yakubu Katsina and his likes in 2002, but 16 years later, Katsina’s ideological ally is in office standing solidly next to him, as he stood solidly next to Isa Pantami. The Izala Movement has won and everybody else has lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only other angle of high level involvement not yet addressed is that of the Jordanian government. Recall that Yakubu Katsina was named among the world’s 500 Most Influential Muslims by a Jordanian state-backed NGO? Well it turns out that the NGO in question - The Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre - is itself affiliated with the Royal Aal al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought. A visit to this institute’s website reveals something strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of its publications titled ‘Report on the Inter-Religious Tensions and Crisis in Nigeria’ published in May 2012 has the following to say about ending violence between Muslims and Christians in Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "This report, produced by a state-funded NGO in Jordan as far back as 2012, is prima facie evidence of a coordinated international campaign of strategic disinformation for the purpose of framing the reality of terrorism in Nigeria in a way that is completely dishonest. Making reference to alleged income disparity between Nigeria’s “Christian South” and “Muslim North,” the report attempts to portray the latter as the victim of economic bullying and poverty, without citing data to support this conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very tellingly, at a time when conversations about violence related to nomadic cattle herding were not yet present in Nigeria’s political equation, a Jordanian organisation with links to Yakubu Katsina - a known Nigerian terrorist - was already recommending “grazing grounds” as a solution for a problem that for the most part, did not actually exist yet.\n",

      "9 years later, the question is…how did they know?\n",

      "EDITOR’S NOTE: A photo of Yakubu Katsina in this article has been updated.

      "On the night of Sunday March 20, 2022, a particular WhatsApp group wouldn’t stop buzzing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Word had got out that a big story that would shake the Nigerian tech space was coming out the next day. Rumour had it that the story was about Nigeria’s highest valued tech unicorn and that the fellow working on it was a certain enfant terrible of Nigerian journalism. For an unspecified reason, this was very bad news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dedicated to Nigerian Tech PR and networking, this WhatsApp group became Ground Zero for the preemptive response to the story, whose very existence was still a rumour. Lawyers were scrambled, friendly journalists were put on notice, social media assets were readied, and a lengthy press release was hurriedly slapped together in response to a story which at that point, consisted of 6 lengthy call transcripts, several unconnected Google Keep notes, a 55MB folder of screenshots and PDF documents, and a rough draft inside my head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Head Fake: The Story That Never Was\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the following days came and went without any sign of the story, Flutterwave’s PR efforts stayed firmly in overdrive throughout this time. First came a flurry of activity in the above-mentioned WhatsApp group when one of the company’s ex employees whom I reached out to for general comment politely said no, only for a screenshot of my conversation with him to start making the rounds a few hours later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the barrage of calls and messages from everyone connected to Flutterwave with whom I had spent the past 6 months in quiet correspondence while researching the story. They all wanted to know, “Why did I just get a call from Flutterwave? I hope I’m not in trouble. Did you tell them I’m talking to you?” “Trouble?” I silently wondered. “It’s a former workplace, not a religious cult, and you’re all adult professionals, not bullied teenagers - what on earth are you so afraid of?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came this from my editor, informing me that - story or no story - Flutterwave was going to put out something in response to whatever it thought my story was going to be about. Someone not in the know might have wondered - why is a $3bn unicorn so terrified about a story that doesn’t even exist yet? What does it have to hide?\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, when the material in question - a fawning 2,300-word PR interview - eventually emerged on April 3, it was an attempt at a direct response to the issues mentioned in the request for comment above, namely employee stock option fraud, sexual harassment and workplace bullying. A little amusingly, it contained a facile attempt to respond to a serious insider trading issue that I briefly teased with an ex employee who had spent our 45 minute conversation referring to Flutterwave as “we.” She incidentally, showed up at the Flutterwave Retreat in Accra, Ghana a few days later.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of this came as a surprise at that point. Since my introduction to the weird internal world of Flutterwave in October 2021, I had witnessed erratic behaviour, sudden panic attacks, group bullying and inexplicable bad faith actions by current and ex staff among each other, competing to get into the good books of a larger-than-life founder who has transcended his birth name, and is now only known by his initials, “GB.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking of Flutterwave as simply a business that processes electronic payments would be like thinking of the New York Mafia as a group of pizza shop owners - there certainly is that, but there is also so much more going on under the hood. This is precisely why I intentionally leaked word of my story 3 weeks ago in hopes of seeing what else this cage-rattling would uncover. I say “what else” because contrary to what I told most of the 17 current and ex-Flutterwave sources I spoke to, this is not in fact, a story about sexual harassment or workplace bullying. It’s not that those things aren’t present in this story - it’s that the real story makes them seem positively trivial in comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we get into that, here is a quick round-up for the benefit of readers who have been living under a rock for the past 3 weeks. After my head fake 3 weeks ago, Flutterwave eventually blinked first and pushed out a lengthy press release attacking 2 former employees suspected of being my sources, including former Flutterwave Head of Implementation, Clara Odero. This turned out to be a mistake. Clara, who runs Credrails these days and does not lack a spine of her own, decided to hit back. A few hours after the Flutterwave press release went out, this happened:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re all caught up, it is now time to dive into a story that is a lot more sinister than you would think. To take us through this weird timeline of events from 2016 to date, I will introduce my 4 principal sources and co-narrators. “Jennifer,” “Ose”, “Sheyi” and “Temi” are the names chosen to shield their identities. Apparently, merely being suspected of speaking out against Il capo di tutti i capi - he of the double consonant initials - could be a red card for any subsequent efforts to work in Nigeria’s small and highly incestuous tech space. Preserving their anonymity is key, so the only detail that will be volunteered is that they are all among the first set of Flutterwave staff, and they all left the company between 2018 and 2021. Here are their stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jennifer: The Consultant Versus The (Lack Of) System\n",
      "\n",
      "Jennifer joined Flutterwave in September 2017. Coming from a senior role at a Big 4 consultancy, it took some doing to convince her to join Flutterwave in the first place. She recalls that she actually had a job offer at Access Bank before The Man stepped in. The Man here is Olugbenga Agboola, also known as “GB,” (and sometimes “Greg” - more on that later).\n",
      "\n",
      "GB somehow convinced Jennifer to take the plunge into a 16 month-old fintech startup. Apparently, GB is blessed with the gift of persuasion, which becomes a recurring theme in the course of this story. Key to Jennifer’s decision to turn down an already-accepted, cushy job offer at one of Nigeria’s largest banks was the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to join an early stage high growth startup and take advantage of its stock compensation plan. Over and above simply earning a salary, such shares in a sufficiently valuable startup can be financially life-changing. Flutterwave was not coy about it either. The offer was printed in her employment letter, and then in her confirmation letter 7 months later.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also had no problem with performance on the job, as evidenced by the following documents from her case, which is currently at the National Industrial Court where she is locked in litigation with Flutterwave.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to court records, Jennifer’s problems at Flutterwave began when - for whatever reason - she fell out of favour with GB despite clearly having no issues with job performance. A list of witnesses in the case summary reveals a list of Flutterwave staff who joined the company around the same time or even later, and some of whom resigned before she did. They all received the stock options promised to them. Jennifer however, did not, despite repeatedly bringing up the subject with GB.\n",
      "\n",
      "For legal purposes, Jennifer did not agree to be quoted directly in this story, but she did however confirm that former Flutterwave CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji signed off on the letter offering her 40,000 shares, which at current market valuation, are worth roughly $2 million. This letter however, vanished into a black hole shortly thereafter, when Iyin was abruptly and unexpectedly fired by GB, leaving him locked out of all company resources including his official email. (More on that later too.)\n",
      "\n",
      "GB meanwhile, continued to sign off on stock option offers for his preferred office favourites, which created a confusing situation for Jennifer. On the one hand, he continued to praise her work regularly and she consistently met or exceeded her performance targets. On the other hand, only those who kissed the metaphorical ring would get these entitlements that were written in their job offer letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps more meta was the fact that even those who managed to get their stock packages ended up receiving pitiful offers that were far below market value for their shares. In February 2021 for example, this ex-employee who asked to be completely anonymous was given an offer of $3.50 per share.\n",
      "\n",
      "The actual market value of Flutterwave shares, as explained in a recent call with a potential Flutterwave investor below, was closer to $20. In other words, GB only permitted this (apparently fortunate) employee to get roughly 17.5 percent of the value of his shareholding. These shares, I was reliably informed, are only permitted to be sold to an investment vehicle controlled by none of other than GB himself at the price he decides. Anywhere else, this would be classified as insider trading. In Nigeria?\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another source I briefly spoke to claimed that it was after a recent conversation with Iyin about her shares while facing this very issue that the tweet below materialised. Feel free to draw your conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, Jennifer felt strongly enough about the injustice done to her that after leaving Flutterwave in 2021 without any resolution, she decided to go to court. She retained the high-flying law firm Banwo & Ighodalo to work on her case. Payment was made and things seemed to be moving well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly and without notice, shortly after presenting a professional opinion stating that Flutterwave was in the wrong and had a case to answer, B&I quietly informed Jennifer that they had been retained by Flutterwave and they would have to drop her case. Apparently whenever Flutterwave wants anything in Nigeria - ethical or not - GB just signs a cheque and makes any problem go away.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact as I found out the further I dug into this maze of documents and recordings, the only way for a Flutterwave employee or ex employee to ensure that GB pays them what they are owed is to weaponise a relationship with one of his investors. He only responds to superior power, not threats, pleas or even lawsuits. The fellow below apparently learned that lesson and used it well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ose And Temi: Flutterwave OG’s Break The Omerta\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let’s take a step back 6 years. The year is 2016 and Iyin Aboyeji has just announced what to all intents and purposes is his new venture called Flutterwave, fresh from exiting Andela. Olugbenga Agboola is the CTO and Co-Founder of Flutterwave, having resigned from his job at Access Bank to take this exciting new dive into burgeoning tech space. Or at least that’s what his LinkedIn page says anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "In reality, as I found out to my mounting amazement, Iyin Aboyeji was never anything more than a corporate front for GB who in fact never resigned from his job at Access Bank, and hid the fact of his concurrent involvement in both entities from investors, regulators and even his Access Bank colleagues. I will repeat that for emphasis: Olugbenga Agboola kept his job at Access Bank while building Flutterwave concurrently for at least 2 years while using a young tech figure as the convenient face of his business. Here is evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In case you are thinking that this was some kind of innocent oversight or victimless crime, consider the next set of top secret messages you are about to see. These messages were as incredibly difficult to obtain as they are damning. In the message below, GB reveals to an employee that he will be “acting as Access Bank” in an interaction, effectively representing a bank he works for while using its resources to drive his personal interest at Flutterwave. Or Insider Dealing, as that is otherwise known.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the message below, GB instructs an employee to advise an external party about the attendance of Flutterwave’s banking partner Access Bank, represented by Adeleke Adekoya at a meeting. The problem is that Adeleke Adeokya at the time also happened to be a Flutterwave co-founder. In other words, for at least 2 years, GB had free reign to use Access Bank assets to benefit Flutterwave without the knowledge of Access Bank or most external Flutterwave stakeholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the messages below, GB is seen enjoying a hearty laugh at the tail end of his time with Access Bank after the bank has found out about his incredibly illegal insider trading arrangement and promptly booted him out. Instead of contrition or humility, he urges employees to approach questions about the illegality with a bold face and throw the onus back to the questioner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally and most significantly, the messages below portray in his true element. Present at a Flutterwave remote meeting while still concealing his involvement in the company from outsiders including Access Bank, he forgets that Iyin is supposed to be answering questions as Flutterwave’s “CEO,” and he jumps in to take charge of the meeting, only realising afterward that he forgot to alter his voice, potentially revealing his true identity as Gbenga Agboola to the other parties on the call. He then instructs an employee to lie that he was not the one whose voice they just heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this message from April 2017, GB remarks that he is being too popularly identified with Flutterwave for his liking. At this point, he is still pretending to be Olugbenga Agboola, Head of Digital Factory & Innovation, Access Bank, while his official Flutterwave email address deliberately does not include a name tag yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "And just in case there is still any doubt about exactly whose show Flutterwave was all along, the message below from April 2017 shows GB promising that Flutterwave staff including Iyin the CEO will “chop cane” (take a beating), ostensibly for poor performance on a crucial call.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early 2018, news about this unholy arrangement got to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has jurisdiction over the Delaware-registered corporation. Under US law, a conviction for insider trading carries a criminal sentence of up to 20 years in prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to several sources, GB, Iyin and - for some reason - Herbert Wigwe flew to the Washington DC for an SEC hearing where they allegedly testified under oath that GB never worked simultaneously at Flutterwave and Access Bank. To confirm whether this actually happened, I submitted an information request to the SEC under the US Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA).\n",
      "\n",
      "The SEC’s response, which came a few days later, declined to grant me access to the records in question citing an exemption under Section 7C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since exemption 7C was mentioned 3 times in the FOIA request rejection, I looked it up and this was what I found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether this means that the SEC currently has an open investigation on Flutterwave, only the Commission itself can answer. I did however, submit an appeal, so we wait and see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember “Greg Agboola” mentioned briefly at the outset? It turns out that not only does GB have a habit of changing his voice so as to pretend to be other people on conference calls, but he also changes his entire identity when it is convenient to do so. In 2016 for example, at the commencement of business, Adeleke Adekoya was given 37.5 percent of the company, with the remaining 62.5 percent supposed to be divvied up between GB and Iyin. GB then informed Iyin that there was a CTO called “Greg” who would need to be given 10 percent, which would be taken out of Iyin and Leke’s shareholdings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which would be fair and unspectacular were it not for the small fact of Greg and GB being in fact, one and the same person.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, I will take a back seat and let the two co-narrators Ose and Temi have a “conversation” which I put together from their lengthy testimony transcripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Ose]: “He is currently trying to shaft investors in addition to everyone else. So the first Angels that they had - he wants to do secondary buyouts, while they want to IPO. And so he will tell them a price that was from several [funding] rounds before like they can’t find the [current price] information themselves. In Nigeria, the reason they had so many chargebacks with Arik was because they were charging cards 3 times. In fact the reason no one has bought Flutterwave is that a majority of their transactions would never pass compliance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "[Temi]: “Someone sent an email detailing all these fraudulent activities to every investor on the cap table, and they are all aware and they talk about it, but they did nothing. After that incident, they put spyware on everyone’s computer. The thing is, if Flutterwave goes down, everyone who is invested takes a hit, and it becomes a problem of who is left holding the bag. Greycroft is the biggest enabler of all of this because they have known this for years, but they keep pushing Flutterwave stock. The company can’t even make it to IPO because when you IPO, you have to show your financials. I don’t know what kind of cooking they’ll have to do with those financials, but the numbers don’t match up. I mean this guy went out and hired the WeWork CFO! I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with that but really? He couldn’t find someone else?”\n",
      "\n",
      "[Ose]: “In case you are wondering why nobody seems to be afraid of losing their money when Flutterwave crashes, the thing is is that it looks like a lot of money to us, but if you look at how much Tiger has invested in Flutterwave versus the size of the fund, it’s not that much money, so they can take the loss. There is vastly more upside than downside to them. If it goes well, they make money in an emerging market - everybody is happy. If it tanks, the loss is a rounding error in global terms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "[Temi]: “You just need to find someone at Access Bank who is willing to talk because when they were audited during the Access-Diamond merger [Q3 2018], they discovered that Flutterwave wasn’t giving them their money. What they discovered was that Flutterwave had been settled, but for some reason, what was supposed to be the bank’s share from these transaction was being settled into Flutterwave’s account and Flutterwave was not remitting it to Access. Why it was even there in the first place is not clear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "[Ose]: “Flutterwave had a deal with Arik Air and there was no paperwork for it. When I first joined, I was told that I need to make this Arik thing work. I was like “Hold on, aren’t you an American company? This shadiness around here is going to make you people go to jail because of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.” Basically someone at Arik started a payments company to process payments for Arik, but he was processing through Flutterwave. So he got a cut of every Arik transaction - and Arik transaction volumes were among the biggest at Flutterwave - but there was no reseller agreement. Isn’t that basically corruption?”\n",
      "\n",
      "[Temi]: “When Arik had the customer data leak and everyone tried to make it seem like it wasn’t a big deal? We knew. We knew, but GB is the kind of person who likes to kick the can further down the road and deal with it later. The problem with that is it becomes so much bigger later, which is what happened. They didn’t secure the data bucket when they should have. I can confirm that the leak was from Flutterwave. We didn’t secure the information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now at least they use AWS. At the very beginning, they were using GB’s aunt’s company as the cloud services provider. Flutterwave is a crime scene from every angle. There is nothing that is 100 percent there. They eat from every corner. GB is also a very insecure man. He doesn’t speak well, he’s not polished and it comes off in how he speaks to people. And now here is a chance for him to be loved finally. So he is doing everything he can to buy the love by getting onto everybody’s cap table, but he’s also doing it to spread his risk because Flutterwave is going down. You can sell investors the IPO dream, but to IPO, you have to put your numbers in order.”\n",
      "\n",
      "[Ose]: “The thing with how the African tech investment space works is that there’s one white boy who comes in, then the other white boys rush in because of FOMO. There are only a couple of people who do proper due diligence when they come in, such as one of the early Alibaba investors who passed on the most recent Flutterwave funding round. Others just don’t like the man [GB] - they think he’s extremely rash and there’s no substance there. So I’ll speak to investors and they say “He’ll tell us he’s building the Stripe for Africa. Next meeting he’ll tell us he’s building the PayPal for Africa. Next meeting he’s building the Square for Africa. And when you ask him “GB what’s the plan?” he goes “Trust me, I’m going to do it. Just trust me I’m going to make this happen.” ”\n",

      "I reached out to Mastercard for a statement regarding their constant problem with fraudulent transactions and chargebacks on Flutterwave, as well as the complaints of of insider trading that also dogged Adeleke Adekoya when he subsequently moved on to Mastercard allegedly without declaring his conflict of interest as a Flutterwave co-founder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The statement from Birgit Deibele, Director of Communications, Mastercard Sub-Saharan Africa read as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for your note and the opportunity to address your questions. With respect to your first point on chargebacks, while we cannot speak to any individual case, we can share that we hold all our Franchise participants to high standards. If we identify or are alerted to potential violations to our rules, we quickly investigate and take appropriate remedial action with the bank that connects merchants to our network. And, regarding your question about Mr. Adekoya, he is no longer employed by the company and there’s not much more we can share with respect to his tenure.

      "Sheyi: Flutterwave’s Susan Fowler Moment?\n",
      "\n",
      "A few weeks ago, while trying to squeeze out all available information from my noticeably reticent sources, I engaged in a little psychological warfare. First, I tweeted an intentionally vague message designed to trigger the relevant consciences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then writing in my BusinessDay column a few weeks later on March 21, I brought up the story of Susan Fowler, the 25 year-old female developer whose brave and detailed takedown of Uber’s toxic internal environment set a domino sequence of events in action, ultimately leading to the fall of former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and a tsunami of similar action across the global tech industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hoped at least a few of my tight-lipped female sources might read it and be inspired by the bravery of a woman who was younger than them when she decided to take on the world. One of these female sources was “Sheyi,” who was once a close friend of GB and whom - every other source mentioned in this story stated matter-of-factly - had a sexual relationship with GB. Ose and Temi recall watching Sheyi have tearful public meltdowns in front of the entire office, hurling colourful language at GB without so much as a light censure in return. Sounding noticeably wistful, Temi remarked:\n",
      "\n",
      "“She was GB’s plaything, and GB has plenty of playthings but hers was the worst. Even after leaving Flutterwave, she is not still free of him because he made sure Flutterwave got a financial interest in the new place she works. Part of the reason some of us are doing this is to try to free our sister from bondage. She can do so much more with her life than this. This is like slavery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of days after the BusinessDay column, I reached out to Sheyi for a possible tell-all. Our Zoom conversation lasted for about 15 minutes, and in the conversation, she hinted very strongly that the things I had heard were true. She neither confirmed nor denied having had a sexual relationship with GB, choosing instead to say that the circumstances of her exit from Flutterwave “were very difficult.” People often reach out to her she said, asking whether to accept an offer from Flutterwave, and she has no idea what to tell them or how to explain it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this veiled admission, Sheyi stated that she was not sure she was “emotionally ready” to tell her story yet, so she would need to sleep on it before giving me an answer. I got my answer the next morning:\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice the subtle use of language here\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordinarily, this should have been where the story ended as far as sexual harassment at Flutterwave goes - a dead end. There was apparently too much fear, shame and plausible deniability to get the actual victims of workplace predation to speak out, not least because none of the other presumed victims I spoke to had any notion of sexual propriety on the part of a powerful entity. As far as they were concerned, the fact that it was not rape made it fully consensual, which therefore made it their fault (and possibly their own personal shame) for agreeing to sleep with their boss.\n",
      "\n",
      "GB himself openly subscribes to this point of view. In 2019, a guerilla Twitter and email campaign against he and CCO Ife Orioke by an anonymous account called “Eko Minaj” resulted in the loss of a potential investor. The anonymous campaigner repeatedly accused him of abusing his position of power by using it to sleep with multiple women at Flutterwave alongside Ife, who happens to be his brother-in-law. I managed to get my hands on a copy of the email thread that went to the investor, causing him to pull the plug on the deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enraged by the loss of investment and loss of face, immediately he convened a Flutterwave town hall to address the allegations of sexual misconduct. The problem is that while the entire campaign was about allegations of sexual and financial misconduct specifically regarding he and Ife Orioke, his rambling town hall speech made generous references to a “right to a personal life,” “right to privacy” and non-invasion of work colleagues into personal space. Nothing about the responsibility of a leader to not take advantage of the less powerful. At a point he exclaimed in the recording below, “Some people are married on paper, but that’s their business!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The unspoken but clear inference from this town hall was that as long as whatever he did with the opposite sex at Flutterwave was fine as long as it was “consensual.” The town hall address portrayed not an innocent blackmail victim or a contrite person, but an angry and defiant man talking about “fighting back” against the anonymous campaigner.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to point out that this view of what constitutes consent has long been disproved by clinical research. A 2018 study led by Vanessa K. Bohns, Associate Professor of Organizational Behavior, Cornell University revealed that in relationships with an uneven power dynamic such as those between a boss and a subordinate, even simple, polite requests can feel like directives when they come from the person in the position of power. Psychologist Adam Galinsky dubbed this the “Power Amplification Effect,” and Prof. Bohns’s conclusion on the subject reads as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "“People in positions of power cannot be trusted to recognize abuses of power they may commit when engaging in a romantic relationship with a subordinate. That ultimately leaves it up to the subordinate to recognize and highlight such abuses if and when they occur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One does not of course, need a clinical psychologist to explain why a boss allegedly sleeping with multiple employees is wrong, regardless of however “consensual” such relationships might be. There is for example, the risk of favoritism, which could ultimately lead to poor corporate governance or poor business performance. There is also the obvious risk that everyone finds out, which in itself is guaranteed to create an unpleasant work environment - but of course the head honcho at Flutterwave knows all of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Ose repeatedly stated, the problem always comes down to the fact that this is Nigeria and there are no consequences for bad behaviour. “Who is going to stop you?” she says. Paradoxically, it could well be Sheyi herself who ends up answering that question if and when she decides to speak up.\n",
      "\n",
      "My final trick was to lay my hands on a secret recording whose existence she was probably unaware of until this moment. In this recording (which I have digitally distorted to conceal her real voice) she promises that one day, given the right push, she will put out a blogpost about her time at Flutterwave and she will “shut the company down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sheyi and most of her co-travelers may not yet be ready to speak up and have their own Susan Fowler moment, but many like “Ose,” “Temi,” “Jennifer” and Clara Odero are currently having theirs. How long is left for what could well be Africa’s most sophisticated fraud operation led by “a Yahoo Boy wearing a suit” as Ose colourfully described him, may just depend on the outcome of this SEC FOIA appeal.\n",

      "In May 2022, shortly after my story about Chinese loan sharks in West Africa went up, a number of new tips and leads started trickling in. It looked at first, as though a follow-up story would emerge, focusing on how some Nigerian banks still offer banking services to illegal loan sharks despite CBN regulations expressly forbidding this. Wema Bank - unsurprisingly - was the most regular offender in this category, lending its support to multiple illegal loan sharks up until as recently as the time stamps in the images below.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I trawled through the leads and my own mounting pile of untold story ideas sitting on my Google Drive however, I started to realise something - there was a much greater issue at play here than a few banks bending KYC rules to bank some customers that ought not to be banked. These were borderline unbelievable stories - stories about aggressively fraudulent behaviour by Nigerian banks presented with evidence that was as devastating as it was undeniable.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is more, these were not stories about a few “bad eggs” in the Nigerian banking sector. Pretty much all of Nigeria’s major banks were implicated, albeit to differing extents.

There is a story about illegal, unauthorised account openings which potentially expose customers to an entire world of pain and liability. There is even a story about brazen collaboration with ponzi schemes and illegal investment programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most alarmingly, there is a common denominator of regulatory weakness and complicity, if not outright collusion across all the stories, which culminates in a story about inflows from Qatar potentially financing terrorism in Nigeria for well over a decade.

      "\n",
      "In 2016, a scandal broke out at Wells Fargo Bank, which at the time was the world’s largest bank. It emerged that over 3.5 million accounts had been secretly opened for customers without their knowledge and authorisation, in response to unrealistic in-house sales and marketing targets. Staff were incentivised to open as many accounts for their customers as possible, and the bank knowingly looked the other way when basic KYC protocols such as customer permission were breached.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to the scandal, Wells Fargo fired over 5,000 employees and paid over $3 billion in penalties under a settlement announced by the US Justice Department in 2020. Given the amount of damaging publicity the scandal received, it became an opportunity for banks and banking regulators around the world to review and tighten their operating practices to avoid getting caught up in a similar mess. In Nigeria however, it was treated not as a cautionary tale, but as inspiration for a potentially even bigger brewing scandal.\n",
      "\n",
      "From May 2022 for example, hundreds of tweets like this began appearing:\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently, to celebrate the 5th anniversary of Wema Bank’s digital banking division ALAT, the bank had set a target for its sales team that could either be described as quite ambitious or entirely insane, depending on which side of the fence you stand on. The target, the bank said, was to open 1 million new accounts in one day. For reference, Nigeria had about 134 million bank accounts in 2021, which meant that Wema wished to increase this number by almost 1 percent in just 24 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even more incredibly, when the bank would later go on to announce that it actually somehow achieved this target, it somehow did not raise an eyebrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from some excellent work by Olalekan Fakoyejo of Ripples Nigeria, the potential severity of the financial crime that had just been perpetrated on thousands - possibly hundreds of thousands - of Nigerians went completely unreported. In some instances, the bank openly admitted to some of these new “customers” who raised a challenge, that they had been illegally onboarded without their knowledge and consent “because someone with their information thought they will be a good fit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When this particular gentleman reached out to the bank via email to pursue the issue further, he got the following response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting aide the disingenuousness of claiming that a customer has nothing to be worried out because an account fraudulently opened using his identity is allegedly not linked to his Bank Verification Number (BVN), this email also failed to deal with an equally pressing issue which he reiterated below.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, there is a clandestine market for private information of Nigerians that Wema Bank apparently has access to. What is more, it is not just Wema Bank. Other banks have also been accused of unauthorised account openings, but perhaps it is the example of UBA that illustrates the sheer depth of criminality and fraudulent behaviour that increasingly characterises the relationship between Nigerian banks and their customers.\n",

      "This particular story is taken from a case file at the Federal High Court in Lagos, where on May 6, 2022, Justice Akintayo Aluko became the first Nigerian judge to issue a ruling against a Nigerian bank for opening an account using a customer’s identity without their knowledge and authorisation. The full case file is available here.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the case file, the complainant, Mr. Chiebuka Nworah received a $450 payment in March 2021. Instead of his UBA domiciliary account which he had opened with the bank in 2020 however, this payment went to a new domiciliary account that the bank had opened for him without his knowledge or permission. Upon receiving an SMS alert from the bank informing him about his new account and the $450 credited into it, he visited UBA’s head office at Marina, Lagos, demanding an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bank’s risible explanation was that it had opened the new account for him so as to comply with the CBN’s ‘Naira 4 Dollar’ scheme which authorised banks to set up domiciliary accounts for customers that did not have them. Seeing as he already had a domiciliary account, this was clearly a nonsensical reason, but the bank refused to refund the money into his existing account or close the fraudulent account, even after he wrote to them with these demands twice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nworah decided to go to court, and then - coincidentally - UBA immediately sent his lawyer a letter claiming that the new account had been opened due to a “system glitch” and that the $450 had been refunded to his existing account. No bank statement or proof was provided to corroborate the alleged refund.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delivering his ruling, Justice Aluko said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The content of the letter of the Respondent’s counsel dated 16/11/2021 is a further confirmation establishing the bank’s violation of the applicant’s right to privacy provided in Section 37 of the constitution. I agree with the Applicant that he is entitled to compensation in terms of damages for the Respondent’s wrongful, unjustified, unlawful and unwarranted breach and infraction of his constitutional right to privacy.”\n",

      "\n",
      "In 2008, Yorkshire Limited, a private company in Lagos took out a loan from Polaris Bank, which was then known as Skye Bank. The initial loan amount remains shrouded in secrecy as I was not able to get hold of the initial loan agreement. All that is known for sure is that it was a 10-figure amount, and all was going well until December 2013 when Skye Bank sent the company a confirmation of its loan balance stating that it was N4,159,319,763.53.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few hours later on the same day, another confirmation of loan balance came in from Skye Bank with a completely different figure on it. This time, the stated loan balance left to be repaid was N5,262,074,147.09. No explanation was offered for why there was a N1.1 billion disparity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alarmed by the unprecedented phenomenon of a bank getting its customer’s account balance wrong by over N1.1 billion, the company requested a statement of account from Skye Bank, and this is where the “fun” started. Skye Bank did not provide the statement or give any reason why. Between 2013 and 2017, the company made several attempts to obtain a statement of account from Skye Bank - something that should normally be provided instantly after a single request.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, no statement was forthcoming from the bank. In October 2017, the company wrote officially to Skye Bank asking for its statement of account. Once again, Skye Bank ignored the request and offered no explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally in December 2017, the company went through the legal route, writing the bank through its legal consultants, Wiseview Legal Consultancy to demand for its statement of accounts. Once again, there was radio silence from Skye Bank. Finally Yorkshire Limited went to court, obtaining a ruling from the Federal High Court in Lagos on April 17, 2018 ordering Skye Bank to provide the requested statement of account immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still Skye Bank refused to produce the requested statement, despite this clearly being a violation of a court order. On April 19, 2 days after the court judgment, the company’s lawyers once again wrote to Skye Bank demanding that the bank comply with the court order and provide a statement of account for Yorkshire Limited. Yet again, Skye Bank responded with - nothing. No statement. No explanation. No conversation. Nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 26, 2018, company lawyers once again wrote to Skye Bank demanding for the account statement as ordered by the court. Once again, no prizes for guessing Skye Bank’s response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yorkshire Limited also wrote to the CBN without getting any significant response. Out of options, the company decided to go to court a second time to get the prior ruling enforced. Instituted at the Federal High Court in Lagos on April 15, 2019, the suit sought to compel the bank (now Polaris Bank following a CBN takeover) to comply with the prior court order and produce the statement of accounts which it had been hiding since 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Share\n",
      "\n",
      "At this time, following Skye Bank’s transformation into Polaris Bank, the Asset Management Corporation Of Nigeria (AMCON) had taken over the bank’s liabilities and assets, including its loan portfolio. Somewhere on this loan portfolio was Yorkshire Limited’s mystery loan without an account statement. In January 2019, AMCON wrote to Yorkshire informing the company that it now owned the loan. No loan balance was stated in the letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Yorkshire’s case in the Federal High Court pending and heading toward another loss for Polaris Bank, a bit of “magic” suddenly took place. First in March 2020, AMCON and Polaris Bank instituted a joint motion to dispute the jurisdiction of the Court to hear the case. This infamous “technical justice” tactic is one that typically characterises Nigerian court cases and keeps cases going indefinitely.\n",
      "\n",
      "This objection was apparently based on an amendment to the AMCON Act. The ruling by Justice T.G. Ringim which can be found here, makes for interesting reading. In the ruling, Justice Ringim ultimately agreed with the objection challenging the court’s jurisdiction, but he also confirmed that neither Polaris Bank nor AMCON had in fact, been able to substantiate their claim of Yorkshire’s indebtedness by providing any documentation to confirm the debt and its amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Ringim did appear to contradict himself in the same ruling. According to him, AMCON’s purchase of Yorkshire’s mystery loan with Skye/Polaris Bank in 2018, as stated by AMCON was also enough fact to suggest that Yorkshire is indeed indebted to Polaris Bank - even though nobody knows how much, including apparently AMCON and Polaris Bank itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yorkshire subsequently filed an appeal against the ruling, and the case remains in court. Why exactly was it so important to AMCON and Polaris Bank that Yorkshire Limited must not have access to its statement of account to find out exactly how much - if anything - it owed? What happened next provides a clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the case still in court, AMCON suddenly began making rapid moves to sell 5 properties in Ikoyi, Lagos, which were used as collateral for the initial loan. Bear in mind that the very loan balance in question had remained shrouded in secrecy since 2013. Somehow, despite not knowing how much the loan balance was, AMCON knew how much was needed from the sale of 5 high-value properties to liquidate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This forced the company to immediately take out a “Caveat Emptor” advertorial in The Guardian newspaper of Monday, June 13, 2022, warning any prospective buyers that the properties are subject to an ongoing legal process.\n",
      "\n",
      "So here we have a poorly run bank that offered multiple balance figures on the same account with a variance of N1.1 billion in 2013, and then spent the subsequent 9 years refusing to issue a statement of account so that the customer might confirm how much they actually owed. Having been dragged to court twice to issue the statement of account, the bank and AMCON - a government body - then teamed up to sabotage a legal process aimed at getting the bank to issue the customer a statement of account. AMCON then went into ‘omonile’ mode, trying to sell expensive properties used as collateral by the borrower with the case still in court.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final icing on the cake? On August 2, 2022, Peoples Gazette reported that the CBN had received presidential permission to sell Polaris Bank to Auwal Gombe, a relative of former military dictator Ibrahim Babangida for a knockdown price of N40 billion, following AMCON’s N1.2 trillion rescue of the lender in 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "Has Yorkshire Limited been the victim of a long-standing play to help politically linked businessmen to gobble up valuable assets (such as Banana Island property) on the cheap by using a bank to basically steal them from their owners?\n",

      "\n",
      "These days, Maxwell Chizi Odum is known as the criminal mastermind behind one of the biggest ponzi schemes ever conceived in Africa. He has been declared wanted by Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and his whereabouts have been unknown since 2021. Once a respected pastor and mentor, he now lives as a fugitive, albeit a rich one, possibly with a second passport and a new identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things used to be very different for ‘Brother Maxwell.’ Following a fairly nondescript corporate career in the oil servicing industry, he came to prominence as a widely liked and admired pastor at the popular Believers’ Loveworld (Christ Embassy) church in Port Harcourt. It was here that he would lay the groundwork for what would become a N213bn heist.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in so often the case in Nigeria, not many people bothered to ask how a Pentecostal pastor with no significant background in finance or investment supposedly figured out an investment secret guaranteed to make them fabulously wealthy. All they saw was that other people paid money into this thing known on the street as MBA Forex, and they came out with amazing double digit returns via an investment system that was far too complicated for anyone to really understand, even if they wanted to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something, something…trading strategy, something…binary forex options, something, something…cryptocurrency volatility. And then something about a matrix-based trading system, which you know, absolutely, definitely, positively was not a ponzi scheme like MMM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally, it was of course, a ponzi scheme, pretty much exactly like MMM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Give a gift subscription\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Nigerian law, the act of soliciting for and receiving monetary deposits from the public constitutes an act of carrying on banking business which requires a banking licence from the CBN. Further, the commercial offer of any investments that promise fixed interest amounts when funds are invested for fixed periods of time is a strictly regulated activity that falls squarely under the oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n",
      "\n",
      "MBA Forex was doing both of these regulated activities despite having no kind of regulatory approval or permission whatsoever. In fact, beyond registration with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) - which pretty much anything with a pulse and a valid ID can do without any kind of regulatory spotlight - MBA Forex was an entirely illegal operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference between MBA Forex and MMM was that while MMM tried to obfuscate its centralised nature by using individual bank accounts, MBA Forex openly accepted funds into the corporate accounts it was somehow able to open at Access Bank, Ecobank, FCMB, First Bank, GT Bank, Sterling Bank, Sun Trust Bank, UBA, Unity Bank, Union Bank and Zenith Bank - despite having exactly zero CBN and SEC authorisation. This is where the story gets interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter a company called World Citizen Equity Partners Limited. This company, purportedly a British company that organises citizenship-by-investment for wealthy people, was registered in Nigeria on March 21, 2018, a few days after MBA Forex was registered on March 14, 2018. WCEP would later claim that it had nothing to do with MBA Forex prior to December 2020, but the screenshot below contradicts this. Keep this in mind because it becomes important later.\n",
      "\n",
      "In August 2020, Maxwell Odum transferred 100 million of his shares in MBA Forex to WCEP, in a transaction that saw some familiar names take up investment positions in the ponzi scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two gentlemen mentioned in the documents above are a former House of Representatives member and a former Nigerian Ambassador to the European Union (EU) and African Union (AU) respectively. Exactly why Hon. Ahmed Aliyu Wadada and Ambassador Usman Baraya decided to buy shares in a ponzi scheme remains unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "In December 2020, MBA Forex met the inevitable fate of all ponzi schemes, and thousands of Nigerians were thrown into mourning as their dreams of making it rich went up in smoke. Over the next few weeks and months, court orders and regulatory actions began rolling in to freeze accounts and potentially reimburse investors. Access Bank, which had hosted the majority of funds harvested by MBA Forex and Maxwell Odum, was front and centre of the investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bank however, decided to conceal the true role it played in aiding and abetting the ponzi scheme. In a sworn statement provided through its lawyer, the bank claimed that it had closed all the offending accounts as soon as it was told to, and that in any case, the main MBA Forex account had just a little over N200,000 left inside it. In an effort to hide the central role it played in enabling Maxwell Odum to get away with the scam, Access Bank also lied under oath, stating that World Citizen Equity Partners (Respondent 10) never had an account with the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "An affidavit sworn by Dickson Ukaha, a former Access Bank customer relationship manager in Port Harcourt directly contradicted this account of events. In his sworn statement, Ukaha stated that not only did WCEP maintain an account with Access Bank, but several transfers worth hundreds of million of naira - the sort that normally raise every AML red flag in the bank - were made from the MBA Forex account to the WCEP account months before the purported sale by Maxwell Odum.\n",
      "\n",
      "So here we have a bank that knowingly enabled an illegal investment scheme without CBN or SEC licenses to fleece customers of billions of naira, and then lied under oath afterward to cover up the extent of its involvement in the MBA Forex fiasco. My source informed me that not only did Access Bank lie about not maintaining a WCEP account, but the account is very much active. Just to be sure, I asked for the account details and did a little test transaction to see if it would check out. And sure enough…\n",

      "A 2016 sanctions summary issued by the UN Security Council provides more context about exactly what this guy is about. The statement reads in part:\n",
      "\n",
      "“In 2013, 'Abd al-Rahman bin 'Umayr al-Nu'aymi ordered the transfer of nearly $600,000 to Al-Qaida (QDe.004) via an Al-Qaida representative in Syria, Abu-Khalid al Suri (deceased), and intended to transfer nearly $50,000 more. Al-Nu'aymi has facilitated significant financial support to Al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI) (QDe.115), and served as an interlocutor between AQI leaders and Qatar-based donors. Al-Nu'aymi reportedly oversaw the transfer of over $2 million per month to AQI for a period of time. In mid-2012, Al-Nu’aymi provided approximately $250.000 for distribution to Harakaat al-Shabaab al-Mujahidiin leaders Hassan Dahir Aweys and Mukhtar Robow, and intended to provide additional funding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Al Nuaimi has been designated a Global Terrorist by the US Treasury Department for extensively funding Al-Qaida activities in Syria, Iraq, and he is also linked to terror financing as far afield as Egypt and Somalia.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is on a global sanctions list reserved for the most dangerous global terrorists, subjecting him to an assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has even been banned from doing business in the UK or having dealings with any bank with a UK office. You know someone is bad news when even the City of London, which has financial dealings with Russian oligarchs and African kleptocrats, is prohibited from touching that person.\n",
      "\n",
      "As much as he sounds like bad news, he also seems far away from a West African audience reading this story. That is, until one realises that West Africa is squarely in his sights as well. Al Nuaimi apparently does not content himself with financing terror in the Arab world or the extremities of Africa. His fingerprints, it turns out, are all over Nigeria as well. Here’s how we know.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early 2022, the Middle East Forum, a US think tank based in Philadelphia got hold of several gigabytes of secret data taken from a prominent Qatari charity. This data showed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of financial outflows to shadowy organisations linked to Wahabbi Islam around the world over a period of up to 2 decades. More on that later, but first a brief explainer about the charity in question.\n",
      "\n",
      "The charity is called the ‘Sheikh Eid Bin Mohammad Al Thani Charitable Association,’ or alternatively, just ‘Eid Charity.’ Its founder is none other than Abderrahman Al Nuaimi, and the organisation itself is member of the ‘Union of Good,’ an Islamic charity coalition which was designated a terror financier by the US Treasury Department in 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its links to terrorism do not end there. In a 2017 paper by Kyle Shideler, Sarah Froehlke and Susan Fischer for the Center For Security Policy, Eid Charity’s managing director Ali bin Abdullah al-Suwaidi, is named as one of 59 individuals designated as terror financiers by the Arab coalition. The same paper names Hashim al-Awadhy, an Eid Charity official, as an individual currently designated a terrorist by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain. The paper continues:\n",
      "\n",
      "Beginning in 2010, Eid Charity worked with and funded Abd al-Wahhab al-Humayqani and his charity organization in Yemen. In 2013, the United States Department of Treasury labeled Humayqani as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) citing that his charity organization was being used as a channel for al-Qaeda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have established that Eid Charity and its founder are heavily linked to terrorism, let’s come back to Nigeria. In February 2022, the Middle East Forum reached out to me with the leaked data, in case I was interested in taking a look at Eid Charity’s activities in Africa. The translated Excel spreadsheet file alone contained over 2GB worth of data, showing over 45,800 transfers from Eid Charity to obscure organisations everywhere from Mauritania to Indonesia, Pakistan, Kenya, Ghana and Niger.\n",

      "\n",
      "The main data file showing the entire global donation footprint of Eid Charity is available here, but if you’re reading this on a phone, I really wouldn’t recommend opening it. It will probably crash your device, such is its sheer size. I extracted the dataset for Nigeria and uploaded it as a more readable PDF here. Feel free to zoom in for enhanced readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data bears unmistakable fingerprints of tactics used by terror financiers, money launderers and other entities with an interest in concealing or obfuscating the true purpose of a money transfer. For example, thousands of transfers to different organisations in different countries on different continents have near-identical descriptions such as “Buying a milking goat for a needy family,” “Building a mosque,” “Buying a sewing machine,” “Drilling a well,” and “Prize money for Qur’anic recital.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrase “Buying a milking goat” appears with minor variations 664 times across multiple donations to different groups in different geographical areas and cultures - including places where goat milk is hardly a dietary staple.\n",
      "\n",
      "The connection to Nigerian banking raises its head when the identities of the 2 Nigerian beneficiary organisations are examined - Al-Furqan Charitable Foundation and a certain “Grass Albar Foundation.” The former appears to be twinned to a Pakistani organisation with the same name, which also appears multiple times across the 45,000+ transaction records. The Pakistani organisation by the way, has been designated a terrorist entity for supporting Taliban militants in Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "No such evidence seems to exist against its Nigerian twin however. Its only electronic footprint - an abandoned Facebook page - appears benign, unless you count this little rendezvous with our old friends from Cornflakes For Jihad, Jama'atu Izalatil Bid'ah Wa Iqamatus Sunnah also known as the Izala Society\n",
      "\n",
      "The second beneficiary however, is where all the KYC, AML and CFT alarm bells go off. First of all, “Grass Albar Foundation” appears to be completely nonexistent. For months I have searched through every database that exists in Nigeria and even enlisted help from friends in DC and London, in case some mention of this mysterious charity pops up. There has been not a single hit. This organisation, which the data shows, received just under $12m from a known Qatari terrorism financier between 2007 and 2019, apparently has no record of existence in Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "This raises a plethora of questions. Since these were all electronic transactions with a paper trail, where did the money go? How was an organisation without CAC (or any other) registration apparently able to open a corporate domiciliary account and receive money from Qatar for at least 12 years? Which banks enabled this? How much of this money possibly ended up in the hands of terrorists across Nigeria? How many more such clandestine funding arrangements still exist within Nigeria’s fraud-ridden banking system?\n",

It had copious amounts of utter nonsense. It had interesting and colourful characters.

His sole reason for incessantly posting on Nairaland was to inform anyone who cared to listen that he was the “Premier of the Republic of Western Nigeria,” or “Emperor of the Western Region of Nigeria.” Following this declaration would ensue several megabytes of data-heavy images and satellite maps to support the existence of his fictional republic.\n",

At 14, she had left Nigeria and moved to the USA, where she lived a broadly prosaic and inauspicious life, before apparently veering into a dizzying chain of bad decisions that culminated in a failed asylum claim in Canada, and ultimately deportation to Nigeria.\n",

They are all false, misleading or overstated in such a way as to make them look like achievements.

      "Fish Story #1 - Kemi the “Doctor”\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 2020, I penned an investigative story about Marek Zmyslowski, the Polish tech entrepreneur who has never been short of a word or three about his time in Nigeria. The story established that Marek was a master in the 3-part conman-in-Africa grift - Be suitably foreign; Look like you know what you are doing; and Be a consummate storyteller. Marek I argued, was not simply a “liar.” He was actually more of a storyteller. The difference between a liar and a storyteller in this context, is that while the liar claims that blue is red, the storyteller mixes in the right amount of truth for their narrative to fly painlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marek for example, would never claim to have worked at say, Deutsche Bank, because it would be too easy to refute such a claim comprehensively. Instead, he claimed to have “founded Jumia Travel.” In reality, he was hired by Jumia as the launch MD of a small travel division called Jovago - which he left acrimoniously 5 months before it was collapsed into the Jumia brand. Clearly, he was not in fact, the “founder of Jumia Travel,” but if you did not know these contextual details, you would easily believe his claims. See the subtlety involved in dishonest storytelling?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, Kemi does not do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subtlety is not Kemi’s thing. Kemi prefers her dishonesty loud and bold, instead of couched in contextual misdirection. For example, sitting boldly on the Twitter bio of her erstwhile self-promotion brand HNN Africa, sits a loud claim that - for whatever reason - nobody has ever bothered to fact check. “30 years practising as a doctor in the USA” is not intended as a joke or ironic reference of any kind - Kemi openly claims to be a US-trained medical doctor with a 30-year work history.\n",
      "\n",
      "On her eponymous Instagram handle, she refers to herself as a “Doctor of Pharmacy,” and she uses the prefix “Dr.” unironically and unambiguously. The clear inference is that she has either an MBBS or a PharmD.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact on at least one occasion, she openly chided an Instagram follower for not referring to her as “Doctor.” Apparently in addition to the long list of accolades above, Kemi is supposedly a doctorate-level healthcare professional. Naturally, since arriving in Nigeria 9 years ago, she has been able to parade this assumed title around, seemingly without any questions from the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only way to end this charade would be to get hold of documents confirming Kemi’s actual academic qualifications from source. That is exactly what I did, and the results are below. A downloadable PDF copy of the DegreeVerify document is available here.\n",
      "\n",
      "It turns out unsurprisingly, that Kemi does not in fact possess any medical qualification other than a BSc in Pharmacy from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science. She is lying about being a medical doctor, never mind with “30 years of experience,” and she is also lying about having a PharmD. She in fact graduated with a Bachelors degree and got a job filling orders in a pharmacy. More on that later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second loud and unsubtle lie Kemi peddles about her alleged medical pedigree is that she was once apparently a “Member of the Governors Advisory Council of Kingston General Hospital in Southern Ontario.” This is a claim that is regularly repeated and reinforced in the Nigerian blogosphere as content writers copy each other while chasing clicks, without the slightest attempt at a fact check.\n",
      "\n",
      "On closer inspection, it turns out that this claim is based on her attendance at the 2010 Annual General Meeting of the Kingston General Hospital, proven by a PDF copy of the minutes of the meeting, which is conspicuously linked on her Wikipedia page.\n",
      "\n",
      "The list in question, it turns out, is actually a list of “Members” of the Kingston General Hospital, and not a list of people on the “Governors Advisory Council”. Kingston General Hospital does not in fact, have any such thing as a “Governors Advisory Council”. What it does have is a Board of Directors, whose professional and academic profiles significantly exceed those of a Pharmacy BSc who filled orders for a living, to say the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Kingston General Hospital also has, is something called the Kingston General Hospital Auxiliary, which is a membership program that anyone can join for free. This membership entitles one to, amongst other things - you guessed it - attendance at the hospital’s annual general meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "What this essentially means is that in 2010, Our Lady of Musiwa joined a free hospital program that allowed her to attend a meeting and have her name included on a list that specified that she was a non-voting member. She then took the absolute non-achievement of being part of a volunteer team and rebranded it as heroic and important service on a fictitious “Governors Advisory Council.” This is an example of the quintessential Kemi Olunloyo fish story - loud, brash, bold, completely divorced from reality, and devoid of the slightest hint of shame.\n",

      "One of Kemi’s most ubiquitous claims is her alleged heft in the music and entertainment industry. Just take a look at the raft of claims below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Editor and Founder of HipHossip.com (Canada's Leading Music Blog-VH1 & MTV (Canada's Leading Hip-Hop site-BET.com) Former VeeJay MTV Base (MTV Africa).

      "Member of the Canadian Association of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS) The JUNO AWARDS and a voting member in the 40th JUNOS. Member of the Hollywood Foreign Press (Golden Globe Awards) Member of the National Academy of TV Arts and Sciences (NATAS) The Emmy Awards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with HipHossip.com, which she loudly claimed to be “Canada’s Leading Music Blog” according to VH1 and MTV, and “Canada’s Leading Hip-Hop site” according to BET.com. Unsurprisingly, there is zero attribution for those supposed quotes. To anyone with a faint understanding of the industry, it is basically impossible for MTV or BET to have issued such comments about a little-known website with just 7 pages of available Google search results. The site by the way, is currently defunct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worse still, of the top 10 search results for this supposed market leading platform, 7 are by blogs and websites run by Kemi herself. This will become quite the recurrent theme as this story progresses, because apart from telling bold lies with the confidence of Cristiano Ronaldo taking a penalty, Kemi has also mastered the art of the artificial echo chamber. Using her dizzying array of blogsites and social media accounts, she successfully controls much of her own online narrative and reinforces the lies she has told in other places.\n",
      "\n",
      "When writing about her, bloggers and less rigorous journalists of course, find it only too easy to copy the available information which she controls. This is how for the past 9 years, she has got away with having a Wikipedia profile claiming membership of a fictitious “Governors Advisory Council” at Ontario’s Kingston General Hospital. Again, more on that later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please nau\n",
      "\n",
      "NBC News, WBAL-TV, V103-FM and Heaven 600AM, Baltimore USA did not respond to my request for comment at press time, but there is absolutely zero online or public database record of Kemi Olunloyo “hosting a talk show” on any of these major regional and national US platforms. As you will discover as you go further into this story, she was in fact the subject of a police arrest that these platforms found interesting enough to do a story on. She did not at any point host a talk show on NBC News - she actually was the news. Once. For a few minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "That brings us to one of the most pernicious and consistent lies that Kemi tells about her professional background - her alleged past as a music industry high roller. For example, she claims to have been a presenter at the 2008 and 2010 editions of the Toronto Independent Music Awards (TIMA). To the unaware, that might sound like an achievement. Until one does some digging and finds out that this is what TIMA is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Worse still, it turns out that presenting awards at said TIMA was something one could literally volunteer for. Putting this on your CV as a supposed music industry hotshot would be like using grainy mobile phone footage from a pickup game of street football to try to convince a Premier League club to give one a contract. The same goes for being a “Member of the Canadian Association of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS)” which oversees The JUNO Awards and being “a voting member in the 40th JUNOS.” Being a “member” of the “prestigious” JUNO Academy in fact, is open to anyone with valid Canadian residency who can pay the princely sum of $75 plus tax. Here, have a look yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for being a “member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association?” Simply not true. Not now, not at any time. In true Kemi style, that claim was picked completely out of thin air. Oh, and the National Academy of TV Arts and Sciences (NATAS) membership linked to The Emmy Awards? Open to anybody willing to pay $125 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to point out how important these deliberate mischaracterisations are to the Kemi myth. She has built a successful grift out of convincing less perceptive Nigerian internet users that she is a well-connected person who is somehow “in the know” about happenings in Nigeria’s entertainment and political spaces. She has pictures with local and international celebrities - Drake, Rihanna and Kanye West among many - so this must mean that she has ties to these people, yes?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the picture above that inadvertently gives the game away. The Much Music Video Awards (MMVA) is a well-attended award show that allows people to volunteer. Ordinary members of the public can volunteer to work backstage, where they get to meet with celebrities and sneak the occasional picture like the ones above. In other words, Kemi took these pictures as a fan, not as an associate - but good luck getting her to admit as much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Go on, it's Christmas!\n",
      "\n",
      "This story is only about halfway, so go have a stretch and a drink then come back because there is more. There is a lot more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such as the little matter of Kemi claiming to have another academic qualification that she does not have. Remember the Instagram and Twitter bios earlier in the story where she claims to be a “PR Specialist”? Well it so happens that on Kemi’s self-curated BizCommunity page, she not only made this claim, but included the name of a prestigious school - Goucher College School of Public Relations - and a 1996 graduation date. This meant that it was possible to fact check this claim. And of course…\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, that’s “Doctor,” “Doctor of Pharmacy” and “PR Specialist” on Kemi’s Instagram bio that will need changing pronto. By the end of this story, “Investigative Journalist” will join that list too, but we’ll get there. I know you’re wondering - surely there cannot be any more Kemi fiction within this subhead that will top all of this? And the answer is…\n",
      "\n",
      "In December 2012, just a few months after being deported to Nigeria, Kemi finagled her way into a byline at the Nigerian Tribune, where she proceeded to pen a lengthy ode to herself and her nonexistent media empire. Toward the end of said article, at the point underlined in red, Kemi claimed to have previously “judged or co-hosted” the Grammy Awards. Amazingly, this got past the editor and this article was actually published. You can see an archived copy of it here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fish Story #3 - Kemi the “Anti Gun Violence Advocate”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I know at this point, it seems pretty clear that the person in question here has a very tenuous relationship with the truth, or even the concept of objective reality. It is important to point out that this may have been the cumulative result of untreated traumatic experiences. Kemi as it turns out, is not stranger to severe trauma.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, there is the relationship with her father, which has always been complicated, to say the least. In this 2015 post, she accused her dad of killing family members in a series of occult rituals. Of course this IS Kemi Olunloyo, so that on its own does not count for very much, but there are deeper reasons that could explain the direction she chose to take in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "These reasons become clear when one digs into Kemi’s past and pays special attention to the period from 1999 to 2007. I mentioned earlier that she had been in trouble with the law, and it was serious enough to receive coverage on television. For the purpose of not straying into private territory unnecessarily, I will direct the reader to this story by the Toronto Star to get a clearer background on how Kemi left the USA and found herself in Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cliff Notes: She had domestic problems involving an autistic child and his apparently less-than-supportive father. She got into trouble with the law after threatening a judge. She then jumped bail and fled to Nigeria after submitting her passport by obtaining a passport renewal from the Nigerian embassy in 2006. In 2007, she and 2 of her 3 kids showed up in Canada and claimed asylum. In 2012, after 5 long years of deliberation, the Canadian IRCC deported her to Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "What this story did not mention is that Kemi already had quite the rap sheet before her 2006 run-in with the law. I got hold of criminal records from Baltimore and Georgia showing her arrest for malicious destruction of property and trespassing on private property, among other things. The full reports are available here and here.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is no coincidence that almost as soon as she arrived in Canada and found herself immersed in a struggle to strengthen her asylum claim, Kemi found a convenient social cause to jump into - anti gun violence advocacy. According to US government numbers, gun violence claimed 661 lives between 2006 and 2007 in the Atlanta municipal region where Kemi lived before jumping bail. Kemi was not at this time involved in any kind of anti gun crime advocacy. Upon getting to Canada however, Kemi suddenly found this to be her new calling. According to Toronto Police Service numbers, 70 people died of gun violence in 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming from Atlanta which had about 9 times the amount of gun violence, the year before, Kemi suddenly realised that gun violence is bad. At this point, she busted out one of her favourite party tricks that you will recognise from her music industry antics - the overstated “volunteer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Overnight, Kemi became the loudest advocate against gun violence in all of Toronto. In what was certainly not an obvious and cynical attempt to strengthen her asylum claim by ingratiating herself with local authorities, Kemi anointed herself as the anti gun crime High Priestess of Toronto. The locals were divided. Some, like the journalist below were amused at her pantomime drama routine, but gave her the benefit of the doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the 5th day of Christmas\n",
      "\n",
      "Some, like this mother of a gun violence victim did not see the funny side of Kemi’s use of her son’s death to push a clear and obvious personal agenda. Speaking to The Toronto Star, Vesna Cikovic, mother of Boris Cikovic expressed relief when Kemi eventually got deported in 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after getting deported from Canada and finding herself growing popular with a Nigerian audience, Kemi would still occasionally carry on performing social media advocacy against gun violence in Toronto. Not even a topic as serious as gun violence however, was serious enough to avoid becoming fodder for yet another one of Kemi’s legendary fish stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the private world of Kemi Olunloyo, nobody and nothing is safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fish Story #4 - Kemi the “Journalist”\n",
      "\n",
      "Most people reading this story have probably seen the Twitter exchange below between Kemi and Stephanie Busari, CNN Nigeria Bureau Chief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kemi is no stranger to telling whoppers, but this quite possibly could be one of the very worst of the lot. If you look at the image at the start of this subhead, you will notice that Kemi included a link to her supposed “CNN Profile.” What you probably do not know is that the link in question does not work, and has been defunct for at least 6 years. Because it is not a byline, and it never was. Kemi Olunloyo in fact, never at any point did any work for CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Subscriber Gave To Me...\n",
      "\n",
      "The supposed “CNN Profile” was in fact, a CNN iReport profile. For those who are not familiar with what CNN iReport was, here is a little explainer below.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, iReport was the mid-2000s equivalent of CNN letting you join its live Instagram video. It was crowdsourced news content before there was Twitter. After there was Twitter, iReport became increasingly less and less relevant, until in 2015, CNN binned it altogether and converted it into the Twitter hashtag “#iReport.” Presenting an iReport profile as a “CNN Profile” would be like winning the annual Lagos Spelling Bee and being “Governor for 1 day”, only to later demand a Lagos State Governor’s pension.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is key to understanding who or what Kemi Olunloyo is.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is not that she tells lies - it is that she seemingly has no self regulation capacity or process whatsoever to measure or judge what sort of lie is worth telling. Take something as simple as someone’s name for example. Why would this happen?\n",
      "\n",
      "And then following a quick and humiliating smackdown, refusal to stop digging.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or take a claim about “being a columnist for the Oshawa Durham Central Newspaper, only for a search on the newspaper’s website to show that you were briefly mentioned in 2 stories, and you have never in fact, done any work for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this painfully obvious lack of basic adult self regulation and competence, Kemi has spent the past 9 years eating up swathes of Nigeria’s public space including - increasingly - getting mainstream media coverage. Where it should be obvious that she is a “journalist” the same way a snake is a lizard, Nigerian print and broadcast media have started inviting her on to share her borderline schizoid delusions with a wider audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "500 USDT...\n",
      "\n",
      "In July, Arise TV apparently forgot the rule about broken clocks, and invited her on to discuss a serious story, as though she were a serious stakeholder with something serious and of value to add to the discourse. Inevitably, she went on and pulled a Kemi - visibly making up stories on air and referencing her imaginary “FBI sources.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe that is actually the story here - that by simply farting out painfully elementary analysis dressed up as inside knowledge, stealing other people’s content and placing a hashtag on it, making up fish stories on the fly and occasionally proving the broken clock rule, every Tom, Dick and Kemi can become a Nigerian media personality. After all Kemi Olunloyo is now a bona fide public figure, and a number of people actually believe that this heiress of Emperor Ademusiwa is an “investigative journalist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As was the case with the Premier of Western Nigeria a decade ago, Kemi has mastered the incredible art of creating and existing inside her very own private universe where she is everything she claims to be. She has even gone a step further and somehow convinced hundreds of thousands of Nigerians - presumably including many smart people - to give her real world attention and social capital in return for colourful fish stories from her private universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that universe - the Kemiverse if you will - she is a Grammy host, an award winning journalist, a PhD Pharmacist or a medical doctor with 30 years of experience, a renowned social advocate, a music industry executive, “the most important woman in Nigeria,” and who knows what else? Justin Trudeau’s secret lover? Owner of a Harry Potter invisibility cloak? Nothing is too much for Kemi. Nothing is too much of a reach. Nothing is too unlikely. Nothing is too shameful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of us are now supporting characters in one woman’s quest to discover how much power, fame and wealth can be achieved using nothing but a fairly active imagination and an inexhaustible supply of bulletproof audacity. If you can ignore the ethical problems and real danger inherent in handing over increasing amounts of public attention, recognition and social influence to the conceptual offspring of Vic-O and Emperor Ademusiwa, you would almost have to respect the sheer amount of heart it takes to pull off this grift.\n",

Finally, this was Sirika’s moment of glory on his last working day as Aviation Minister; the day that the phrase “Nigeria Air” would stop being an internet meme.\n",

      "There was even a water cannon salute to welcome the aircraft. For reference, such salutes in this context are given when an airline is landing at an airport for the first time. This is an important point that we will come back to later.\n",

To all intents and purposes, Nigeria’s latest attempt at launching a national carrier to compete continentally with the likes of Kenya Airways, Ethiopian Airlines and South African Airways had finally, belatedly sparked into life following “a very long, tedious, daunting and difficult path.”\n",

      "In reality, none of what actually happened remotely resembled the way it was presented.

Yes, there was a water cannon salute and the guests at the event bellowed out the national anthem to their heart’s content, even as speculation began circulating about Nigeria Air ticket prices and destinations. All of that happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what also happened was that as soon as the event ended and everyone went home, the aircraft quietly disappeared from Abuja and reappeared the following day at Bole International Airport, Addis Ababa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next time someone took a photograph of the aircraft was on May 31, 5 days after its “Official Unveiling” in Abuja. By this time, its “Nigeria Air” branding was nowhere to be seen, and it was flying for Ethiopian Airlines - more on them later - from Addis Ababa to Mogadishu. Here is how it looked:\n",

In Nigeria, the country code is ‘5N’. To cut a long story short, it would be in gross violation of ICAO and NCAA regulations for any Nigerian airline, let alone a Nigerian national carrier to operate an aircraft that is not registered in Nigeria. This was clearly not a Nigerian aircraft, let alone one belonging to “Nigeria Air”.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this was pointed out, a number of pro-government voices predictably jumped to the defense of Hadi Sirika, making noises about ownership stakes, aircraft leasing arrangements and majority shareholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not even they could muster a defense when on Tuesday May 30, Nigeria Air Managing Director Dapo Olumide confirmed to a House of Representatives committee on aviation that his (now-ex) boss had chartered a 737 from Ethiopian Airlines and branded it for the purpose of a “static display” 3 days to the end of his tenure as Minister of Aviation. Sirika himself attempted some damage control with a TV appearance on June 11 where he claimed among other things, that the aviation ministry did not organise the event and that “investors” did so for marketing purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, even though the aviation ministry printed and sent out official invitations and event programs; even though he put out a triumphant message hailing the arriving Boeing 737 as “the end of a very long, tedious, daunting and difficult path;” even though he had spent weeks beforehand insisting that “Nigeria Air” would have its inaugural flight before May 29, thus creating the impression that a 1-day branded charter flight was in fact the inaugural “Nigeria Air” flight - none of this was Hadi Sirika’s fault. It was just “the investors” (more on them later too).\n",
      "\n",
      "We must at this point segue into a brief examination of Hadi Abubakar Sirika, in order to understand why he would even attempt such Nwude-level public fraud. Who exactly is the man who was Nigeria’s Minister of Aviation until 3 weeks ago? What is his background and how did he get that job? Short answer - nobody really knows. The only source of any sort of historical information on him appears to be a poorly-written Wikipedia article which the - typically incurious - Nigerian media establishment has quoted verbatim and recycled for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is repeatedly claimed that Sirika was once a pilot, having attended the National College of Aviation Technology (NCAT) in Zaria, Kaduna, before studying at the “Petroleum Helicopters Institute”, Flight Safety International, and Delta Aeronautics, all in the USA. A quick refined search on Google shows that the “Petroleum Helicopters Institute” is mentioned only in articles about Hadi Sirika. Nowhere else on the entire internet does this “Petroleum Helicopters Institute” get a single mention.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Fugazi\n",
      "\n",
      "The “Petroleum Helicopters Institute” does not appear to exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even more curiously, Hadi Sirika has never provided any evidence that he was ever in fact, a pilot of any note. For an African helicopter pilot in the oil and gas industry, there is really only 1 place to be in the world - Nigeria’s offshore/Niger Delta region. Where did Hadi Sirika earn his stripes as a rotary wing pilot after allegedly graduating from 4 different flight training schools in Nigeria and the USA? Was it Aero Contractors? Bristow? Caverton? None of the above?\n",
      "\n",
      "All that is really known about him in fact, is that in 2003 - at the ripe old age of 39 - he supposedly retired from his aviation career whose existence has never been proven, and went into politics, winning the House of Representatives election for Katsina North. In 2007, he contested in the Katsina North senatorial election and won, remaining in office until 2011. In 2015, armed with the formidable qualification of being a son of the president’s older sister and a graduate of 4 aviation schools - one of which appears to be fictitious - he was appointed Minister of Aviation by the famously meritocratic and not-at-all nepotistic President Muhammadu Buhari.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hadi Abubakar Sirika\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have established that the Minister of Aviation behind Nigeria Air is a career Fugazi who has failed his way up for the past 20 years, we can rejoin the main story. And this is where it gets interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sirika claimed during his TV appearance that Nigeria Air had moved beyond the first of 5 stages involved in obtaining an Air Operator Certificate. This directly contradicted Captain Dapo Olumide’s testimony before the House aviation committee (a testimony made under oath). Why this is important is that apart from Sirika telling yet another lie, if you think of an Air Operator certificate as a medical licence, then referring to a Stage 1 applicant as an “airline” that will “soon have its inaugural flight” would be just like referring to a 100-level fresher as a “doctor.” Here’s an explainer of the 5 stages of getting an AOC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now here is a letter I recently got my hands on, which shows exactly who has been telling porkies between Senator Sirika the Fugazi pilot and Captain Olumide, former MD of Aero Contractors and Virgin Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t worry, it gets worse. It always gets worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after the charter flight stunt became a national scandal, raising chuckles in Kenya and receiving coverage in Le Monde, Sirika and Nigeria Air began receiving public shows of support from an unlikely source - an Ethiopian one.\n",
      "\n",
      "A respected figure in investment, advisory and consulting spaces, Fairfax Africa Fund Chairman Zemedeneh Negatu was the last person one would expect to stake their reputation for the sake of a Nigerian scam. Yet that is exactly what began happening as he insisted that - somehow - despite being on Stage 1 of the AOC process which takes a year at the very minimum, Nigeria Air would become a reality by the end of 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, it was also pointed out that this “airline” did not even have a website and had not recruited any staff. Shortly after this was pointed out, a hurriedly-designed Nigeria Air website clearly built off a cheap Wordpress template - with the placeholder “lorem ipsum” text still there - was unveiled to the public\n",
      "\n",
      "A “WhoIs” query revealed something even more farcical about this entire operation. Apparently it had not occurred to Hadi Sirika and his co-conspirators that an airline tends to need a little thing called a flight booking website. It was not until May 26 - the date of the “Official Unveiling” that someone realised that the “airline” without an AOC that they wanted to unveil using a vinyl-wrapped, foreign-registered charter flight, might just so happen to need a website. Take note of the registration date and the name of the website owner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, having been caught with his pants firmly around his ankles after the wordpress template site became the butt of jokes on Nigerian social media spaces, this is what the founder of Folio Media Group had to say about Nigeria Air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Even though! Even though!”\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact when one steps back to scrutinise Nigeria Air as a Hadi Sirika project, it quickly becomes clear that the whole thing was one giant - pardon me for using this term again - Fugazi. There really was no plan. Today the prospective technical partner would be Emirates. Tomorrow it would be Ethiopian Airlines. The day after, Qatar Airways. This was clearly a man who was entirely out of his depth and promoted vastly beyond his capacity, having known nothing but reward for failure all his life .\n",
      "\n",
      "So now comes the big question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why on earth did Ethiopian Airlines even want anything to do with this poisoned chalice called “Nigerian national carrier” in a deal to be overseen by an incompetent no-mark with no significant career in aviation? And why would a well-travelled, widely-respected investor and alumnus of 2 of the world’s Big 4 management consultancies reduce himself to shilling this flaming ball of nonsense on the internet?\n",
      "\n",
      "Complete with the ludicrous timeline and everything\n",
      "\n",
      "What was in it for them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, quite a bit as it turns out. To be more specific, there was everything in it for Ethiopian Airlines - zero material risk and a great opportunity to thoroughly plunder the internal aviation market of Africa’s most populous country with the full knowledge and acquiescence of the “retired pilot”-cum-clown heading its Aviation Ministry. Here’s how we know this:\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after the May 26 “unveiling,” the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) put out a statement denouncing Sirika for going ahead with the sham event despite a subsisting court order. The statement contained the following paragraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We discovered a mind-boggling and dangerous agenda to kill all indigenous airline operators and handover a monopoly to Ethiopian Airlines in a dubious and fraudulent way against the economic interest of Nigeria, hence our court action supported by strong material evidence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That dear reader, was no exaggeration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following images are taken from internal Nigeria Air documents that I got my hands on a few days ago. These documents, which include the airline’s Shareholders Agreement, the Establishment and Operations Agreement and the Management Contract, contain eye-popping clauses that would have quite literally taken every existing Nigerian airline out of the market and gift-wrapped Africa’s 2nd largest internal aviation market to a foreign entity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take this one for example, taken from the Establishment and Operations Agreement. Article 7.2 states that Nigeria Air would be legally registered within a Free Trade Zone for tax purposes, with such exemptions extending to the airline’s activities at all airports in Nigeria. In plain English, what this means is that Nigeria Air alone would be granted perpetual tax-free status among all airlines in Nigeria, and its tax free status would extend to everything and anything it does anywhere in Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just for emphasis, this clause is reiterated later in Article 32.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "To put the true danger of this in perspective, below is a recent ticket booking for a Lagos - Port Harcourt flight using an existing local carrier. The taxes on this ticket add up to 8 percent of the total price. In a notoriously low-margin industry like aviation, using state power to build a permanent 8 percent price advantage over every other player in the field is as good as stopping the game and carrying the ball home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 7 in the Establishment and Operations Agreement states that Nigeria Air is entitled to advantaged status on all prime routes - domestic and international - at all available frequencies. What that means in English is that the airline must be given preferred status on the most profitable routes and awarded as many slots on those routes as are available. In other words, if Lagos-Abuja is the most profitable route in the country, this airline must be given the right to use its tax advantage from above and ‘compete’ with local operators on that route using the resources of Ethiopian Airlines (a behemoth that made $5bn last year). No one needs to be a genius to work out how that will end.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same document, Article 11.8 states that the shareholders of Nigeria Air (i.e Ethiopian Airlines and a few private investors) must be given forex access privileges that are not given to any other airline operating in Nigeria, including behemoths like Emirates and British Airways. Whereas airlines continue to complain about having three-quarters of a billion dollars stuck in Nigeria, this clause would give Ethiopian Airlines free and unconditional access to forex for whatever reason it deems fit. In the event that any shareholder pulls out of the airline, this clause also entitles them to immediate settlement of their investment in USD. Mere mortals in Nigerian aviation may have to negotiate with the CBN to access forex for fuel, wages and maintenance, but Ethiopian Airlines would get whatever it wants from the CBN unconditionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then there is the shareholding issue. Sirika was famously reluctant to state exactly who the “investors” supposedly are in Nigeria Air. This excerpt from the shareholding agreement below appears to clear that up once and for all. That is, until you carefully read the highlighted portion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why is it so important to specify that MRS will subsequently divest just over half of its current shareholding to “a single and/or other Nigerian investors”? Who exactly are the “single and/or other Nigerian investors,” and what makes them so important that even though they are not named, their interests are already baked into the shareholders agreement of a national carrier with a built-in state capture advantage? Could they perhaps, be a Politically Exposed Person?\n",
      "\n",
      "Say, for example, an Aviation Minister who does not want an entity directly traceable to him to appear on the cap table of a national carrier, whose birth he midwifed with ludicrous built-in anti-competitive advantages that will guarantee an aviation market monopoly in Nigeria? Could it be that an entity on the cap table is holding that person’s shares in trust, to be quietly divested to him at a conveniently unspecified later date when he is out of the public eye and nobody cares anymore?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes we have more answers than questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting aside issues of state capture and corruption, there is also the simple fact that from a Nigerian point of view, this is a bad deal, while from an Ethiopian point of view, Nigeria and the people governing it must be the biggest mugs on the planet. In Article 4.19 of the Shareholders Agreement below, the Strategic Partner (Ethiopian Airlines) is required to pay for its 49 percent shareholding in Nigeria Air, not through an equity injection or even from its earnings in the venture - but from “basic rent of aircraft leases.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What that means in plain English is that Ethiopian Airlines will own 49 percent of what is on paper, Africa’s largest internal aviation monopoly, and rather than pay for this privilege or earn it by deducting from its dividends or operating income, it is in fact Nigerians who will indirectly pay for it. It is Nigerian travellers whose airfares will pay for the aircraft leases that will finance the 49 percent shareholding - essentially funding the Ethiopian colonisation of their own aviation space.\n",
      "\n",
      "On paper the deal remains unsigned, but not for lack of enthusiasm from the Ethiopian side. The “retired pilot” at the Ministry of Aviation, through his incompetence and short sightedness, has effectively allowed a savvy group of actual aviation experts to write themselves the deal of a lifetime at Nigeria’s expense - the sort of lopsided deal that the world has not witnessed since Dutch colonist Peter Minuit bought Manhattan from the Lenape Indian tribe for less than $1,200 in today’s money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which finally brings us to the Optimistic Ethiopian-American investor with a big reputation in corporate consulting and private equity investment, who now shills this half-Nigerian-aviation-Thanos, half-punchline-without-an-Air-Operator-Certificate on Twitter. What was in it for him?\n",
      "\n",
      "Zemedeneh Negatu\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite a bit too, as it turns out. The final document I got my hands on shows how much exactly. The investment banking terms offered by Negatu’s Fairfax Africa Fund to the Nigeria Air consortium include some very generous concessions. Here, take a look:\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s in it for him? Why don’t we use his own numbers to calculate a figure? If this $250m valuation of Nigeria Air that he and Sirika have repeatedly bandied around is accurate, then his proposed fee worth a 1.45 percent share of that figure would come to a nice cash windfall of $3,625,000. To be spread out across 3 annual payments, because he’s nice like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice work if you can get it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Fairfax Partners would also get a guaranteed seat at the table whenever this monopoly airline would have another funding round or an IPO. Maybe it would be a $10 million fee next time? The firm would also get to determine which companies provide services to an airline that was being artificially set up to become Nigeria’s biggest airline from Day 1 via state capture. Why would anyone need first refusal and supplier recommendation rights to a monopoly market operator? Certainly not for potential insider dealing? Or potential insider trading? Or for kickbacks?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes we have more answers than questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the alleged helicopter pilot who retired from aviation at 39 to go into politics, promptly failing his way up impressively into the aviation ministry, which he left with the iconic image of airport water cannons saluting a vinyl-wrapped charter flight with foreign registration, he was last seen fighting a new set of battles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing Nigeria, he will probably become president someday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe.\n",

      "Definitely.\n",

      "Green Africa Airways And The Man Who Stole An Entire Airline\n",
      "\n",
      "“Like I said, I’ve noticed this “I” statement and trend in you lately which never existed in our relationship for years. Babawande, let me remind you, you did not take the risk alone. We both did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Babawande Afolabi\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not a story about an airline. Not primarily anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "While an airline is integral to the story, it is the furious legal and social battle surrounding it that has made Green Africa Airways - once touted as the Nigerian answer to Ryanair or Southwest Airlines - take centre stage. This battle has turned childhood friends and business partners into sworn enemies, pitching previously inseparable families against each other in a maelstrom of high-powered lawyers, angry investors, multiple court cases and EFCC petitions, and even (alleged) arson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we get into all that, first, a quick primer about Green Africa Airways and why there was once such a buzz around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Green Africa Airways was billed as the low-cost airline that would do for Nigerian aviation what Henry Ford’s mass-produced cars did for American car ownership in the 20th century. Something, something…democratise…something, something…for the common man. You’ve heard it a thousand times before and you get the basic picture: flying is fundamentally expensive, especially in a country whose monthly minimum wage works out at just under $50.\n",
      "\n",
      "An airline that could figure out how to charge less than its competitors and still remain in business would quickly become the most successful in the Nigerian market, and would possibly help in improving the overall viability of Nigeria’s 21 local and international airports. (Currently, only four of that number have sufficient passenger numbers to pay for their own expenses without government intervention.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Green Africa solution was as simple as it was elegant - cut costs wherever possible. Jet aircraft burn more fuel making them more expensive to run in a Nigerian market where sourcing dollars for Jet-A1 is a challenge? Use turboprop aircraft instead. Training and type rating pilots across different aircraft makes and models in the same fleet the way conventional airlines do it is time and capital intensive? Buy a fleet made up exclusively of ATR 72 turboprops so that pilots only need to be rated on that one type, and air crews are more interchangeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the choice of colour scheme is part of the ruthless cost-cutting since the colour white on aircrafts fades less quickly and requires less pigment than other colours, reducing the repainting frequency and takeoff weight of the aircraft which saves money. Basically, in Nigeria’s extremely price-conscious market, Green Africa would to do aviation what per-second billing did to telecoms in the 2000s.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that out of the way, our story now begins in 1983 in the sleepy town of Ile-Ife, Osun State. In this town which is recognised by most of West Africa’s Yoruba ethnic group as the ancient cradle of their civilisation, a boy was born to the Afolabi family. According to Yoruba naming customs, it was believed that the boy was the reincarnation of a male ancestor, and so his father Francis gives him the name “Babawande” (“father has returned”).\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearby was the Awosika family, which had maintained a long-standing relationship with the Afolabi family. This family, dotted with successful entrepreneurs and corporate figures including a former First Bank chair inhabited an entirely different space from the Afolabis on the socioeconomic spectrum of Ile-Ife, but that did not stop the 2 families from being close friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former First Bank chair Ibukun Awosika\n",
      "\n",
      "As Babawande grew through his childhood, the Awosikas’ son Kenny became his best friend. Both families became so close that on more than one ocassion, Kenny’s dad Kolawole paid school fees on behalf of Babawande’s younger siblings Taiwo and Kehinde. The idea of repayment was neither discussed nor expected - such was the level of closeness between both families.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the years went by, Kenny left Nigeria to obtain an education and build a career in the USA, but both friends never lost touch with each other and their relationship remained strong. So strong in fact, that in 2006, after finding his way to Wesleyan University in Connecticut, USA and realising that he was $12,700 short on his tuition, Babawande turned to his best friend for help.\n",
      "\n",
      "His best friend as always, was all too willing to help. Kenny signed up to be his student loan guarantor - something that needless to say, only a tiny proportion of Americans would willingly do for someone they are not related to. Thus Babawande avoided losing his admission and possibly having to return to Ile-Ife at that crucial juncture in his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few years later, Babawande - let’s call him Wande - actually defaulted on a couple of payments triggering a number of stressful phone calls between Kenny and the loan company, but even that was not enough to shake the friendship that these 2 had nurtured for nearly 30 years. In fact that was just the start of the close personal and business relationship that they would share going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometime in September 2013, having long discussed dreams of someday setting up a business together to make an impact in Nigeria, the 2 friends were having a random conversation on Google Hangouts. As you will see below via the conversation transcript, this informal chat is what became the basis for the business entity they would later register together in the state of Maryland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both friends excitedly discussed their plans to do something huge in Nigeria, even debating whether to fully involve Kenny’s girlfriend in the business from the start and how she would potentially feel about visiting Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, Babawande and Kenny got down to setting up enterprise email accounts for this business and choosing a name for it. Bear in mind that at this point, the proposed business did not even have a well-defined focus just yet - such was the level of mutual enthusiasm and trust between both men. They eventually settled on the name “Green White Group” in an unsubtle nudge to their dreams of making a huge splash in Nigeria’s business landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like that nearly 10 years ago, our 2 friends started on a journey whose culmination at least one of them could not possibly foresee.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is at this point that the story started taking a huge left turn for Kenny - not that he knew it at the time. Over the next 2 years, while he busily threw himself into the business of registering, funding and building Green White Group in Maryland, USA, he had no idea that his best friend was planning to perform an epic rug-pull on him in the future. They did everything together, from dealing with IRS tax issues to negotiating a deal to bus a Volvo bus for an intercity transport business in Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the time being, there was no doubt that the business relationship between both men centred around Green White Group, which they co-owned. This is illustrated by the images below taken from the investor pitch deck for GWG’s Nigerian road transport company called MyCityBus.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is any doubt about the level of involvement and commitment that Wande displayed to the business of running Green White Group, the email conversation below should clear that up decisively. Keep this in mind because it become important later in this story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometime in 2014, Wande came up with an idea to start an airline in Nigeria. A bus transport company was just not ambitious enough for him and he believed they could do more. A low-cost airline following the JetBlue model could potentially unlock hundreds of millions of dollars worth of value and put their names up in lights forever, just the way Wande always envisioned. Kenny, though initially hesitant, began to warm up to the idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "He warmed up to it so much in fact, that he personally handled practically all of the branding and design work that is recognisable today as “Green Africa Airways.” Here, take a look:\n",
      "\n",
      "The full email exchange is available here. In fact, even the name “Green Africa Airways” also came out of an email exchange between both friends during this period. Kenny also brought the first set of seed investors into what was then known as “Air Africa” before they settled on the name “Green Africa Airways.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep all of this in mind because it is important information.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is far too much information to publish\n",
      "\n",
      "In case you are wondering how on earth I have access to all of this information, the answer is “because it’s in court.” All of these documents technically have been on public record in Lagos State since 2020 as part of a bitter legal dispute that remains unresolved to date. What happened?\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see below, Green Africa Airways - let’s call it GAA - initially pitched to investors as a fully owned subsidiary of Green White Group, which Wande and Kenny co-owned. But something else entirely was happening on the ground in Nigeria. At this time, Kenny was singlehandedly funding GAA’s operations from his personal account in the USA and raising investment from his friends and family in the US, while Wande was in Nigeria pursuing the gruelling NCAA licencing process for GAA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kenny first voiced a concern when Wande proposed that instead of writing to the NCAA as “Green White Group”, they should instead write using the letterhead of the Nigerian entity “Green Africa Airways Limited.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kenny wanted to know how his interests would be represented since he was a part owner of Green White Group and did not have shareholding in this new Nigerian business entity. By this time, had had spent as much as $20,000 of his own money on the project. Wande assured him that this was only a temporary arrangement to get around NCAA rules against foreign ownership of local airlines. Once they got the licence, he assured his friend, everything would be sorted out!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you groaned while reading this exchange, that is probably because you instantly recognised the classic signature of a manipulator and a confidence trickster in that conversation: The feigned hurt at what was a perfectly reasonable question; the “don’t worry, just trust me”, which leverages a pre-existing relationship between both parties; the “I can’t believe you think I would do that to you”emotional blackmail; the way the victim immediately backed away from pursuing a satisfactory answer to his valid question; the little pat on his head from the smug conman afterward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kenny crucially did not recognise any of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was after all, his childhood friend whom he had known for decades; the man for whom he had stood as a student loan guarantor; the man whose family was tight friends with his own; the man who had squatted in his house after graduating from Stanford Business School. Why on earth would he of all people try to cheat him out of his equity in an airline that they had built together brick by brick off the back of his personal money, from a Google Hangouts chat to a multimillion dollar investment opportunity?\n",
      "\n",
      "As it turned out, that is exactly what Wande was doing in Nigeria. After using Kenny’s expertise and funding to sort out GAA’s branding and build its IT systems, as well as raise over $73,000 from seed investors - something that catalysed much larger subsequent investments - he was finally ready to cut his childhood friend loose. Now was his time to become the multimillionaire rockstar founder he always wanted to be - without having to share the limelight with Kenny Awosika the rich kid who did not deserve the things that he had.\n",
      "\n",
      "On GAA’s CAC registration documents, Kenny’s name was conspicuously missing. In its place was Wande’s younger brother Taiwo Afolabi (remember him?)\n",
      "\n",
      "Even worse, Wande attempted to cover his tracks by incorporating 2 new entities in Delaware and London called ‘Green White Group’ without Kenny’s knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the point when Kenny discovered this, the alarm bells finally at long last, went off inside his head, and he took legal advise. First came a sternly-worded demand letter to Wande informing him that Kenny expected his shareholding to be reflected on the company’s books immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "What that had no effect, the next course of action was a petition to Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Explaining what happened in an excerpt from the subsequent petition, Kenny said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“While I was making effort to secure investors, I discovered I was duped me by Mr, Babatunde Afolabi by converting all the monies I sent to him to his personal use and with false pretenses, he fraudulently registered Green White Group (GWG) UK and Green White Group (GWG) Delaware without including my name. Babawande Afolabi then linked GWG UK as parent company to Green Africa Airways, Nigeria (now worth $54 Million pre-Series B valuation). It was at this time that I discovered had been scammed by Mr. Babawande Afolabi.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The extent to which Kenny was used by Wande in setting up GAA can be seen below in an excerpt from the EFCC petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realising that they had also been scammed by the fraudulent de-linking of GAA from the original Green White Group, a group of seed investors also petitioned the EFCC about Wande’s giant advance fee fraud scheme which had collectively left them $73,500 out of pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it gets really dark from here, so feel free to have a stretch and come back later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wande’s response to all of this was as silent as it was sociopathic. First, he filed an action at the High Court of Lagos State contending that the EFCC investigation “infringed on his fundamental rights” and that he was a victim of “harassment.” The full document available here is a truly horrifying read. Incredible lie after incredible lie; whopper after whopper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kenny was never the Director of IT and Innovation of Green White Group Limited” (there is a pitch deck in this story that says otherwise); “There were no ownership percentages when Green White Group was incorporated\"; “GWG did not file any taxes”; “Kenny’s name was included because he was an American citizen…”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then came the emotional blackmail from Wande and his legal team. First was a smarmy offer to discuss Kenny’s “unfounded” claim to having 50 percent of Green Africa’s equity and to “assess” how much in their not-at-all-meaningless opinion he should actually have. Refusing this offer to discuss a percentage settlement with the person who stole one’s money and investment would presumably make one “uncooperative.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came actual blackmail in form of a letter from GAA’s newer investors. They wanted Kenny to know that if he did not drop his case against Wande, it would be a “colossal loss of opportunity for everyone including you, millions of people in Nigeria, and Africa.” In the time-honoured fashion of a predator trying to hustle a financially insecure person into signing a poor deal, the letter informed Kenny: “You have a short window of opportunity to determine whether to secure your future and that of your family, or genuinely end up with nothing from this venture.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kenny Awosika\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately or unfortunately, Kenny happens to be an Awosika - and they generally don’t tend to be financially insecure people. So then came a $650,000 offer for him to drop all claims and basically disappear, forever wiped from the history of the airline he very literally set up with his own time, money, resources and connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsurprisingly he had no interest in this offer either. Wande promptly upped the offer to a “full and final offer” of $1.5m. Presumably, Wande and Green Africa were so generous with investor money that they were happy to offer $650,000 to someone they claimed was just a disgruntled, overentitled former IT consultant, and then more than double the offer 23 days later, completely unprompted. Nothing to read into that at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "But somehow, it still gets even worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship between the Afolabi and Awosika families had at this point, completely broken down to the point where Wande’s father, Francis Afolabi wrote the following stinker to Kenny’s father, even offering to repay the school fees paid for Taiwo and Kehinde all the way back in the year 2000.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re thinking “Surely this must be the climax of the story,'“ well, no. It’s not.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re still getting there.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his response to Wande’s fundamental rights enforcement motion against the EFCC, Kenny revealed what happened the first time he truly understood his place in Wande’s life, and how his erstwhile bosom friend actually saw him. Describing his and The Applicant (Wande’s) encounter with a High Net Worth investor, he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "In a subsequent response to Wande’s motion against Kenny and the EFCC at the High Court, Kenny revealed that shortly after he rejected the derisory offers from Wande’s lawyers and returned to the USA due to security concerns, his house at 11305 Appledowre Way, Germantown, MD, 20876 - which was also Green White Group’s registered address for all those years - mysteriously burned down.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found this to be an incredible claim, so I cross-checked publicly available images of that property with any available social media posts and news stories from 2019 about a fire at that property. And here is what I found, courtesy DCNewsNow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loading video\n",
      "\n",
      "So yes. That happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story is just about over, but I should mention finally that shortly after all of this happened, Wande then sent this personal message to Kenny, requesting a one-on-one “Rebirth Meal” for them to somehow reconcile. This I think, is a good place to end, because the psyche of a sociopath is best expressed in his own words\n",
      "\n",

      "A Russian-trained academic cum business mogul, Prof. Okonkwo is also the spokesman of the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON), the umbrella pressure group of the major operators in the airline industry which has been at the forefront of pushing for seamless operations of the sector as the fulcrum.of the economic growth of Nigeria. In this interview, he speaks on a plethora of issues and offers some suggestions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excerpts:\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has become president and commander-in-chief. How would you describe his administration in the last nine months without prejudice to your political leaning or affiliation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, this is a time for governance and not politics. This is a time when all hands must be on deck. And I’ve contributed my quota to the economic development and stability of this country, bearing in mind that I’ve never had any government appointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can only see a period of so much confusion, a people overwhelmed from all aspects of it, and for that reason, there has been a lot of inconsistencies and policy summersault. That gives me some concern. The Tinubu we used to know is said to be capable of head hunting for the best people in different positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this presidency appears to be proving otherwise. We had expected him to embrace a better national outlook based on his relationships across the states and zones, we expected him to bring in a lot of great people who would support this national objective. But that’s not the case. It is not that those he has appointed are not qualified, but there are greater potentials out there. But we expect him to be bold enough to make critical changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nigeria, today, is in the ICU section of a hospital, and all the specialists are needed to do an evaluation. This is not the time for just one doctor to attend to a normal patient who needs just routine checks. There is no time to waste now because this team does not look like a winning team. The drive and the demand of the moment appear to be too overwhelming. All we seem to be hearing is that we should be patient, and patience appears to be running out. That is why you are seeing some of the things you’re seeing, where people are involved in breaking into warehouses, hijacking trucks on the road, and carting away food items.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they have plans, Nigerians are not being carried along. Things are not going well. Yet, in the midst of this, some people are living the affluent life, not because their businesses are doing well (that is if they have a business) but because they are close to those in government or they are in government.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they claim that they are doing some things, and the patience they are asking for is contingent on their belief that they are doing some things across sectors. They also say they inherited an empty treasury, that they inherited a dead horse that was standing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Expectedly, they are supposed to be doing something, but in a situation like this, policies that will resonate with the masses are needed. We have seen some of their policies, it is one harsh policy after another and these policies are not only making things harder for people, but these are policies that seem to be dealing with symptoms, policies that are merely scratching the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Give one or two examples of such policies for clarity?\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at the CBN, for instance. The CBN is focusing on reducing the money in circulation, and the MPR rate being raised, itself, raises some fundamental questions. Where is even this money they claim they want to reduce? It is the same CBN that will be telling us that 60% or so of the money is not in circulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, where is that money in circulation that they are chasing with different policies? I would rather think that increasing the interest rate will lead to higher rates from the banks. We were already crying that it was 26%, now it will move to almost 30%. That is where you are clear that there is so much money in circulation in the hands of the real sector and it is chasing a smaller amount of dollars out there. But the same CBN knows for a fact that 70% of all the resources, apart from the one they say is there and nobody sees, are in the hands of those in government and that is what is being used to mop up the dollars being stashed in different places. Would it not have been better for the president to have a round table with these governors and government officials and not embark on policies that are very theoretical. Deal with the issues and stop scratching the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "They said they have stopped the subsidy and the FAC allocation has increased. You are supposed to see more activities from the bottom up. Now, some of these governors have been appointed as part of the economic team to solve a problem that they are a part of. Again, you claim you inherited an economic mess, yet some of the people in the previous administration’s economic team are re-appointed into your own new economic team. How can banks be making multi-billion profits, and the real sector is going down? So, I ask, how is our own so: The real sector is going down, and the banks are making money, so, what are they doing? Okay, you sit down with bankers, governors, and cement manufacturers as part of your economic team, yet the problems of the country can be traced to those sectors. To get things working, you’ll need policies that will impact those sectors. So, how will that be done when the captains of those sectors are in the economic team?\n",
      "\n",
      "Before you go further, there seems to be this consensus that state governors and top government officials are the ones mopping up dollars because of the spike in FAC allocation. Is there any proof to this claim because many experts seem to be saying the same thing about the instability in the forex market? Is it just an assumption, or is there a basis for this claim?\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d raised the alarm sometime in January about the nexus between the increase in FAC allocation and the instability in the forex market. What is going on in the forex space is speculative. I’m in the real sector, and we don’t even see these dollars. We scavenge for dollars to stay in business. The increase in FAC allocation should be wonderful, but we have a situation where state governors play god and decide on how the funds are spent. Look, APC has a majority of the states and I do not see why it is difficult for the FG to call – even if it is APC – governors who should be interested in the success of the APC federal government and be on the same page, instead of allowing the state governors to run riots with funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concerns and cries are coming from corners that are far from Abuja. Where is the place of the councillor and the LG chairmen? We have been talking about the devolution of powers, and it was such a strong issue during the campaigns. But here we are today, and people are now sitting pretty and enjoying the powers of centrality. You are in government to do what is best for the people. People are complaining that the policies are killing, yet people are carrying on as if the people do not matter. The policy should affect the people positively.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d also said that we should watch out for food. I’d said whatever the government is doing, the issue of food production is key, but I do not see this government upholding some policies targeted at food production as pursued by the last administration. Hunger is a very dangerous thing, and the last administration put in certain policies that were impactful, and they were going directly to the beneficiaries. But today, it appears different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, look at the way people are being fired from the boards, and many are yet to be replaced. This vacuum is creating its own dysfunctional vibes within the system. Meanwhile, you took over from an APC administration. One of the biggest problems the Buhari administration created for itself was that when it came in, without appointing ministers for almost seven months, boards were dissolved, 18 to 19 permanent secretaries who were acting ministers in their ministries were also sacked not because they were due. They were then told to hand over to the highest officers in their ministries, and these so-called most senior officials were just directors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Expatriate Employment Levy sent shockwaves around the real sector penultimate week when it was launched; but it’s now been suspended?\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let’s acknowledge and commend the reversal by the government for now. Look, we are already spending thousands of dollars to formalise the expatriate quota in Nigeria. It would have been a nightmare for companies that are already suffering under the weight of taxes. The companies need to survive first and in some aspects they need foreign components. Let me tell you, Jide, with the current exchange rate today, you do not need any policy to tell anybody to replace expatriates with Nigerians where you can. We have expatriates and we know how much we are paying but there are areas where you need the expatriates because there are MOUs you have signed and the companies are insisting that for technology transfer, those expatriates must be on ground. There are also areas of maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would have affected the aviation sector more, I guess?\n",
      "\n",
      "In aviation, for instance, there are equipment that you need to bring in, and for you to operate them, you need the expatriates because we have not developed the capacity here. Between October and December last year, I had to send over 40 people overseas (Cyprus and Jordan) to get a time on the A320. They went there to understudy, and before they come back, they still have to work with some of the people in that aircraft before we now replace them. I do not think it really has anything to do with employment. In my view, I think it is the desperation to generate revenue. But in the cause of generating revenue from LGs to state and FG, this tax issue is being misunderstood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aviation sector generally…\n",
      "\n",
      "(Cuts in) The aviation sector is bleeding seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s frightening?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yes! This is the part where we have to say it the way it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "A recent report said the number of aeroplanes in the fleet of some airlines is dropping?\n",
      "\n",
      "And they are continuing to drop. I can tell you that about 40% has dropped and in the next one or two months it might get to 70% drop in fleet. And it is not the fault of the aviators.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what is the real problem?\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, 99% of aviation is forex, and the currency of aviation is dollar. So, starting from those who are marketing JetA1 fuel, they bench-mark their cost in dollars, and all the spare parts you need are bought in dollars. Unlike your car, which you service when you notice something bad, it is not the same with aviation. There are services that you must do by calendar whether you fly or you do not fly; some services are by cycles whether you like it or not. What this means is that things must be done as they should be done, not as you like because if you do not follow the procedure, the aircraft is grounded. You’re doing all these with dollars. But now you can not access the dollars, and 100% of our earnings on domestic flights are in naira, which is losing value. The ticket you sell today in naira, by the time you convert it to dollars to buy spare parts and do maintenance, it has been up by almost 30% to 40%.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can tell you that for almost nine months, we have never had an official allocation of forex for airlines. Every airline is buying from the parallel market. So you’re buying in the same market with somebody who is importing Brazilian hair, toothpick and those who are also mopping up the forex. It should not be so because aviation is a catalyst for economic growth, and it has national security implications. Some of us still have in CBN huge sums of money we’ve been debited for two years now: We do not have our money back and the dollars we did not get.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait! You mean you paid for forex, you were debited, but there’s no forex yet?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes! You bid and wait for a few months. But now it is almost 18 months. Before it was we in the aviation sector, which used to complain a lot, but now it is affecting everybody, so you hardly hear from us again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is that not a recipe for disaster in the air? I pray not, but wouldn’t people be cutting corners?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, no, no! It won’t. The only impact is what you’re seeing – a reduction in the fleet. Nigerian regulators are very tough, and operators are also very sensitive. I fly in my own aircraft. My first choice is my own aircraft unless the schedule does not permit. We fly in each other’s aircrafts so we observe the best practices you can find anywhere in the world. It’s just the loss of jobs, reduction in the number of planes, and that is bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s look at this issue honestly, too, because there was a time when it was said that aviators were involved in round-tripping when the federal government tried to provide support for them with forex…?\n",
      "\n",
      "That may have happened over a decade ago, and I do not know about that, but since I got in in the last 10 years, I’m not aware of that. The situation is different, and that could have happened because the monitoring systems were not effective, and it couldn’t have happened without official collaboration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s look at the Igbo nation. How do you think that part of the country can fully integrate so that what it has lost from the centre will be regained. I’m talking about expectations from the central government and what it should do to endear itself to the Igbo people?\n",
      "\n",
      "Interesting question! I believe in the unity of this country, and it is one that can be achieved based on equity, justice, and fairness. We can not continue to talk about what Igbos should do to be integrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, the question is, what do Igbos expect? Igbos appear to have contributed their own quota?\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. The counterpoise would seem to suggest that the Igbos have been doing something wrong all along. Yes, we may not have been calculating well politically; we may not have been getting it all right. But the fact of the matter is that if this is our thing and you accept that I am part of it, you have to be equitable in the process of sharing. So, the blame should go to those sharing and deliberately depriving that other person. Igbos are everywhere, and they are working hard, but they are being marginalised. Even the constitutional appointments are given to those who are not true representatives in terms of choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "What should now be done?\n",
      "\n",
      "The people who share must be fair. When you favour others more, you should expect people who are being deprived to complain. One of the things being done to weaken people is to deprive them of their rights. Meanwhile, these people give their best in every area where you have appointed them. But what I have seen is that people in political positions think they know everything, so they lump politics and knowledge together. The political class can not separate itself from the intellectuals. You must have some people somewhere who do the thinking, and then the politicians, working with bright minds, can then implement. Because of the disregard for education and intellectual issues, we keep fumbling as a nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have great minds from the southeast, but when you see the quality of some of the appointments, you’ll wonder whether these are the best Igbo people can offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my view, the misreading of the political barometer appears to have conflicted some Igbo leaders in such a way that whereas there are charlatans (as you have in every tribe in Nigeria), some who appear to even be genuinely pursuing Igbo interests within the praxis of a bigger Nigeria are sometimes pilloried or scoffed at by their fellow Igbos. This has not also been helpful because even those who are genuine are seen as enablers of the oppressors. So, how would you situate past efforts of leaders in trying to get the centre to do right?\n",
      "\n",
      "You know these things are never done in secret. Every individual has antecedents and records. Igbo people are intelligent enough to know leaders who genuinely want their progress, regardless if it is a government they want or they don’t want. When they see that person, they will rally around the person without inhibitions. But when they test some people, they see the pretence when people pursue their own agenda while pretending to be pursuing Igbo interest. Or when you see the appointment of somebody by the centre as further deliberate action to weaken the Igbo nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the people see those things that you know will not work well, the people resent that. Some people thrive by scandalising their own people to get favour from the centre. It will also not be out of place to posit that the centre does it sometimes to sabotage the Igbo nation by empowering untrustworthy people just so such individuals will go back home and become a thorn in the flesh of the people. Igbo people know their own, and the people know genuine leaders when they see one.\n"

      "\n",
      "The Presidency also debunked the insinuation that the 2024 budget being implemented by President Tinubu is anti-North.\n",
      "\n",
      "The denials were contained in a statement issued by the Special Adviser to the President on Information and Strategy, Mr. Bayo Onanuga, titled, “The facts about 2024 budget.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Onanuga said President Tinubu is leading a government that is fair and equitable to every part and segment of Nigeria, adding that in terms of funding, distribution of capital and priority projects, the 2024 Appropriation Act was not skewed against any section of the country.\n",

      "He further explained that the North as an integral part of the country is well covered in all areas, from security to agriculture, healthcare to education, and other important infrastructure such as roads, rail, dams, power and irrigation projects to support all year-round agriculture.\n",
      "\n",
      "The statement read: “Following the false claims made by Senator Abdul Ningi, representing Bauchi Central, that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu-led Federal Government is operating two versions of the 2024 budget, we consider it appropriate to inform Nigerians that there is no truth whatsoever in the allegation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Acting under the banner of Northern Senators’ Forum, Senator Ningi, falsely claimed in an interview he granted BBC Hausa Service, that the National Assembly debated and passed N25 Trillion as 2024 budget and not the N28.7 Trillion that is being implemented by the Federal Government.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To begin with, President Tinubu on November 29, 2023 presented a budget of N27.5 Trillion to the joint session of the National Assembly made up of N9.92 Trillion recurrent expenditure, Debt Service N8.25 Trillion and Capital Expenditure N8.7 Trillion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This was widely reported. He did not present a budget of N25 Trillion. “Contrary to the strange view expressed by Senator Ningi, there was no way the Senate could have debated and passed a N25 Trillion budget that was not presented to the National Assembly.\n",

      "“We don’t expect a ranking Senator not to pay due attention to details before making wild claims.\n",

      "“The National Assembly, in its wisdom, increased the amount proposed by the Executive by N1.2 Trillion.\n",

      "“In the spirit of democracy which allows give and take, President Tinubu didn’t withhold his assent to the Appropriation Bill as passed by the National Assembly. We want to stress that if the budget figure was increased and made to be different from what the Executive proposed, it was the National Assembly that jacked it up in exercise of its power of appropriation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the uncharitable claim that the 2024 budget was anti-North, we found such position as canvassed by Senator Ningi as too far-fetched and unbecoming of a leader of his status.\n",
